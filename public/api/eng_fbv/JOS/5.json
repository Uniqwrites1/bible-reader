Some link it to slavery in Egypt, but more likely is it related to the Israelites' rebellion at Kadesh (Numbers 14) and God's decision not to allow that generation into the Promised Land. Initially he had threatened to destroy them, but Moses intervened, mentioning how much this would please the Egyptians (Numbers 14:13). The disgrace then would be that the Israelites had failed God by rebelling against him, and God would be perceived by the Egyptians and others as being unable to keep his promise. The act of circumcision (a sign of God's favor) brought the situation full circle back to the Exodus, and now the entrance into the Promised Land.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":9}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_fbv/JOS/5.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_fbv/JOS/6.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_fbv/JOS/4.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":15}
