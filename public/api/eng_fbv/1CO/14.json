There is much debate over this phenomenon. Clearly the early church was gifted with the ability to speak and be understood in different human languages as Acts 2 makes clear. However, some kind of “ecstatic utterance” appears to be in view here.

The fact that just 3 chapters earlier in 11:5Paul refers to women praying and prophesying indicates that this statement cannot be read as a blanket ban on women speaking in church.
