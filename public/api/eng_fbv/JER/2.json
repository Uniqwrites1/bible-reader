This avoids too many quote within quote marks, and also it is sometimes problematic to differentiate between God's words and those of the prophet himself. In addition there are many times when the phrase “This what the Lord says” is repeated frequently which should normally start a set of quote marks, ending up with a large number of “nested” quotations. A similar situation exists with the phrase “declares the Lord,” which also should be outside quote marks, but would add considerably to their number. For this reason quote marks are kept to a minimum and generally used only when speakers other than Jeremiah or the Lord need to be represented.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":2}},{"noteId":5546,"caller":"+","text":"Hebrew: “Kittim.” The meaning is to go to the farthest west.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":10}},{"noteId":5547,"caller":"+","text":"Kedar was far to the east.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":10}},{"noteId":5548,"caller":"+","text":"“Memphis”: Septuagint reading.
