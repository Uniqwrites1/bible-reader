The observance of new Moon festivals was part of Israelite worship but had become corrupted (see for example Is. 1:13) so this could be now taken as a symbol for pagan worship. In addition the northern kingdom under Jeroboam had instituted different festivals which were not ordained of God (see 1 Kings 12:33). The main point is the corrupting influence of pagan beliefs on the genuine worship of the true God.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":7}},{"noteId":5156,"caller":"+","text":"The three places mentioned are on the northern border between Judah and Israel in the territory of the southern tribe of Benjamin.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":8}},{"noteId":5157,"caller":"+","text":"See a similar image in Isaiah 8:5-10describing the end of the northern kingdom at the hands of the Assyrians.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":10}},{"noteId":5158,"caller":"+","text":"This verse has been linked to the decision of King Menahem of Israel's decision to agree to a huge payment in silver to the Assyrian king as a means of avoiding conflict (see 2 Kings 15:19-20).
