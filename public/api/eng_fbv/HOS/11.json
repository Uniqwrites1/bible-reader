What the Hebrew text appears to be saying, in the context of the Exodus from Egypt, is that as they (Israel) called them (Egypt) was the way in which they (Israel) went from them (Egypt). In other words even at the Exodus Israel was hankering after the things of Egypt and only left under pressure. Many would have preferred to stay, and Hosea traces the apostasy he is dealing with to a reluctant and rebellious spirit of some even at the time of the Exodus. This is confirmed by the second part of the verse.","reference":{"chapter":11,"verse":2}},{"noteId":5191,"caller":"+","text":"Literally, “arm.”","reference":{"chapter":11,"verse":3}},{"noteId":5192,"caller":"+","text":"In the context of the Exodus see Exodus 15:26.","reference":{"chapter":11,"verse":3}},{"noteId":5193,"caller":"+","text":"The image shifts to care for a farm animal.
