Literally it is, “not near to build houses. It (the city) the cooking pot, we the meat.” It may be that the first part is a negative reaction to Jeremiah's advice to build houses for an extended exile in Babylon (Jeremiah 29:5). Alternatively, some interpret the phrase to mean that soon it will be time to build houses in Jerusalem again—in other words the crisis will pass. As for the cooking pot analogy, some believe it may suggest that the people (the “meat”) are safe in Jerusalem (the “pot”). Others see this as an expression of fear, of becoming like meat being boiled in a pot.","reference":{"chapter":11,"verse":3}},{"noteId":4693,"caller":"+","text":"It seems that the people of Jerusalem were suggesting that not only were the exiles in Babylon far away from the Lord in terms of distance, but also in their relationship with him. They also seem to be suggesting that the exiles had broken their agreement with God because they were no longer permanently occupying and owning the country of Israel.","reference":{"chapter":11,"verse":15}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_fbv/EZK/11.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_fbv/EZK/12.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_fbv/EZK/10.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":25}
