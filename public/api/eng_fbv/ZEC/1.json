But it should be noted that this is a description of God's opposition and intense hostility to evil and rebellion, rather than anger as experienced by human beings which is very self-referenced, emotionally-based, and even irrational. God's anger is a rational response to wickedness, and is based on his desire to save and heal, rather than to exact retributive vengeance. His focus is on making sure people understand the terrible danger they are in by pursuing evil.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":2}},{"noteId":7817,"caller":"+","text":"Literally, “The Lord Almighty says, Return to me, declares the Lord Almighty, and I will return to you, says the Lord Almighty.” The repetition has been removed for easier reading.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":3}},{"noteId":7818,"caller":"+","text":"Literally, “regulations.”","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":6}},{"noteId":7819,"caller":"+","text":"“With their riders.” Implied, see verse 11.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":8}},{"noteId":7820,"caller":"+","text":"Implied.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":11}},{"noteId":7821,"caller":"+","text":"“Pacified.” In the context this “peace” has more to do with being forced into submission and defeat than a time of harmony and tranquility.
