Much has been written about this concept and the terms used, and “covenant” has often been retained as there does not seem to be an effective way of explaining what is meant here. The covenant concept is extensively developed in chapters 8 and 9. Problems exist with alternative words. The word “contract” can mean the result of bargaining, which is not the case here. Similarly “treaty” or “agreement” when seen in human terms may refer to mutual negotiations. But here the word refers to something that is God's initiative, and certainly is not between equals. Perhaps a better concept is “a promise that is agreed to with corresponding obligations,” but such wording would be even more cumbersome.","reference":{"chapter":7,"verse":22}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_fbv/HEB/7.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_fbv/HEB/8.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_fbv/HEB/6.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":28}
