The psalmist has been referring to his enemies as “they,” but from verses 6 to 19, the person being addressed is “he.” While there is no indication in the text that a different person is speaking, it seems very likely that the psalmist is quoting the words of his enemies against him. (Quotation marks were not a part of ancient punctuation.) This is the more compelling when the content of what is being said is examined. While writers of the psalms certainly do condemn their enemies and call on God to act against them, in no other psalm is there a request for inappropriate action such as the perversion of justice in rendering a guilty verdict, or counting prayers as sins. In addition the context provided by verses 1 to 5 reveals that the whole theme is one of lies and deceit practiced by the psalmist's enemies. For these reasons verses 6 to 19 are placed in quotation marks here, believing that these words originate with those who are accusing the psalmist.","reference":{"chapter":109,"verse":5}},{"noteId":7408,"caller":"+","text":"This may refer to the appointment of an unjust judge to hear the case.","reference":{"chapter":109,"verse":6}},{"noteId":7409,"caller":"+","text":"In this verse the psalmist returns to speaking of his enemies, and wishes all that has been said rebounds upon them.","reference":{"chapter":109,"verse":20}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_fbv/PSA/109.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_fbv/PSA/110.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_fbv/PSA/108.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":31}
