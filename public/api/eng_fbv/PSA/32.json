In the first they are “carried away” (the Hebrew meaning of forgiveness), while in the second they are “covered” in the sense that they are no longer seen, rendered invisible. As in all metaphors, such concepts are limited since one can argue that sins cannot be “removed” in that the actions cannot be undone, nor are sins amenable to a “cover up” operation—meaning that while they are concealed they are still there. In all such discussions the wider concepts of the meaning of sin must be considered: as primarily a broken relationship with God, with wrong attitudes and actions that lead to separation and death.","reference":{"chapter":32,"verse":1}},{"noteId":7122,"caller":"+","text":"“Kept quiet”—not confessing his sin.
