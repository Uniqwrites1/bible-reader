Some take this line to refer to the man and wife become one flesh, as noted in Genesis. Others see the “not one” as the subject of the sentence and so another possible translation would be something like: “No one would have acted like that if he had a remnant of the spirit.” Some have seen the “one” as referring to Abraham as the father of Israel, and the fact that he divorced Hagar may have cited as a precedent by some for their divorces. The response then would be that Abraham was protecting the “children of God” through Isaac. Whatever the case, it seems best to leave some of the ambiguity present, though in the context of discussing marriage relationships it would seem that the original design for marriage in Eden would be a relevant aspect for Malachi to mention.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":15}},{"noteId":6469,"caller":"+","text":"“A violent attack on the wife”: literally, “covers his garment with violence.”","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":16}},{"noteId":6470,"caller":"+","text":"This may be a reference to mindless repetitions of prayers.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":17}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_fbv/MAL/2.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_fbv/MAL/3.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_fbv/MAL/1.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":17}
