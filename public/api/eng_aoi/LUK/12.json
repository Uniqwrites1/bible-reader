There were so many that they were crowding close and treading on each other.

So don't you be like those men,"]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["because anything that is hidden today will be made clear later."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["All the words you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the daytime.

Maybe they will kill you. But when they kill your body and you die, there is nothing else they can do to hurt you."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["But I will show you the person who should make you really afraid. You should be afraid of God, because he is very powerful. If he wants to he can kill you and your body will die, and he can also throw your spirit into hell. If he does that, you will stay there forever. Yes, I am warning you. He is the one you should be afraid of, because he is so powerful.”"]},{"type":"heading","content":["About God looking after us"]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["Then Jesus went on to say, “God is powerful and he will look after you. Maybe one of you will buy five little birds for only a few cents. But God looks after every one of the birds. He doesn't forget any; he doesn't miss seeing even one, and he keeps on looking after them."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["God looks after the little birds, and he will look after you too, and he won't forget you. He even knows about your hair. He has already counted it all and he knows! So don't be afraid, because God takes care of the little birds, and he takes care of you even more. He looks after you because you belong to him.”"]},{"type":"heading","content":["We shouldn't be ashamed of Jesus"]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["Then Jesus said, “If one of you says to other people, ‘I belong to Jesus Christ,’ then I, who was born in this place, will say, ‘This man belongs to me.’ I will speak so that God's angels can hear in heaven."]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["“But if one of you says to others, ‘I don't know Jesus Christ,’ when you deny me like that I will say, ‘I don't know that man, he doesn't belong to me.’ I will say it so that God's angels can hear in heaven."]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["“If any of you speak bad words about me, the one who was born in this place, God will forgive you.

In this world you collect many things, but they get old and spoiled. Some might get lost, thieves might steal some, and white ants might eat some of them. But that doesn't happen in heaven. Thieves don't steal and white ants don't eat anything there. All your treasure will last there forever."]},{"type":"verse","number":34,"content":["“If God is your Lord you will always think about him.

There was once a man who went to celebrate with a friend who was getting married. He and some other people celebrated with his friend and had a feast. His servants waited at home for their master to come back. They sat up waiting and didn't lie down or take off their coats to sleep. And they didn't put out their lamps. They waited and waited. Then at last their master arrived and they heard him knocking on the door. They got up quickly, opened the door and brought him inside."]},{"type":"verse","number":37,"content":["It may have been in the middle of the night or before dawn when their master came back, but they were still waiting. He was pleased because his servants hadn't gone to sleep and were waiting for him. He took off his coat and brought some food and made them sit down. He gave them their food even though he was their master. He was happy and he made his servants happy too. That master made his servants very happy because they had waited for him."]},{"type":"verse","number":39,"content":["After Jesus had told his disciples this story he said to them, “You too must wait patiently until I come back here. You must wait like those servants. But don't be like one man who owned a house. He didn't know that a thief was coming. If he had known, would he have let the thief come inside? Of course not. The owner of the house would have been watching."]},{"type":"verse","number":40,"content":["“And you disciples of mine must wait for me, because I, the one who was born in this place, will come back again when you aren't expecting me. I will come back while you aren't watching.”"]},{"type":"heading","content":["About God's workers working well"]},{"type":"verse","number":41,"content":["Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, that story you told us, is that just for us or for everyone?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":42,"content":["The Lord Jesus said to Peter and the other disciples, “Tell me. What is a faithful and wise servant like? His master has made him the boss over the other servants. So he gives work to those men and women and he gives them food from his master every day. But how will he work while his master isn't there? He should work well all the time while his master is away."]},{"type":"verse","number":43,"content":["“Then when his master comes home and sees his servant working well, he will be very pleased. And his servant will be happy too."]},{"type":"verse","number":44,"content":["Then his master will make his servant the boss over everything he has.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":45,"content":["Then Jesus said, “But maybe that same servant will say to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time to come back.’ Then he will beat the men and women when he gives them their work. He won't work well any longer and he will do careless, bad work. He will eat a lot of food while his master isn't there and he will drink strong drink and get drunk."]},{"type":"verse","number":46,"content":["“After a while his master will come back again. He will arrive suddenly, while his servant isn't thinking about him coming back. Then what will the master do to his servant? He will give him a hard beating, just like people beat those who are bad."]},{"type":"verse","number":47,"content":["“And this is another thing,” Jesus said. “One servant knows everything that his master wants him to do, but he doesn't work well for him. So his master will give this bad servant a hard beating."]},{"type":"verse","number":48,"content":["But another servant doesn't know what his master wants him to do, and he doesn't work well for him. So his master will give this bad servant a little beating, because he doesn't know.” Then Jesus said, “When God gives you important work, you must obey him and do good, honest work for him. And if God gives you more important work to do, you must obey him and work even harder.”"]},{"type":"heading","content":["About Jesus coming into the world to judge everyone"]},{"type":"verse","number":49,"content":["Then Jesus spoke to all his disciples and said, “I came into the world to judge everyone, to see if you are good or bad. It will be just as though I am lighting a fire to burn rubbish. If only the fire were already burning now!"]},{"type":"verse","number":50,"content":["But it isn't burning yet, because I must suffer first. “When I suffer, it will be like going right down under suffering.

I am very sad about it, and I won't stop being sad until it is finished.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":51,"content":["Then Jesus said, “What do all of you think about me? Do you think I have come here to stop people fighting? No. I came here so that people would argue about me and make trouble for each other because of me."]},{"type":"verse","number":52,"content":["“Maybe there are five people living in the same house. From today three of them will hate the other two."]},{"type":"verse","number":53,"content":["Maybe a father and his son will hate each other. Maybe a mother and her daughter will hate each other.

You should talk about it carefully together. Maybe he will take you to the judge because of something wrong you have done. While he is taking you, the two of you should talk about it as you go, before you get to the court. Don't wait, but try and make that person happy so that he will forgive you. “If you don't make him happy, then he will take you straight to the judge. The judge decides about people, whether they are good or bad. He will give you to a soldier who will put you in jail. Then you will stay there for a long time.
