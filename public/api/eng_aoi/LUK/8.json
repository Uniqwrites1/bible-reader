The twelve disciples also went with him."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["Some time before this, Jesus had made evil spirits come out of some women and he had healed others. One day he made seven evil spirits come out of one woman called Mary. They called her Mary Magdalene because she came from Magdala. And those women also went with Jesus."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["Another woman called Joanna went too. Her husband was called Chuza, and he was an important man who worked for King Herod. Another woman was called Susanna. Many women went with Jesus and his disciples. They took their own food and money, so that they could look after the men and give them food."]},{"type":"heading","content":["About a man who planted some seeds"]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["At that time many people kept coming to Jesus from all different places. And when a big crowd of people gathered he told them this story."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["Once a man decided to grow some seeds for food. He put the little seeds in a bag and went off. As he went along he threw them on the ground, scattering them freely around everywhere for the plants to grow. As he went along scattering them, some of the seeds fell on the path. In a little while when people came along they trod on them, and the birds came and picked them up and ate them."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["Some of the seeds fell on rocky ground. Then when the seeds began to grow they dried up because the ground was dry."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["Some of the seeds fell in the middle of some thorns. Then the thorny plants and the good plants both began to grow and so they grew up together. But the thorny plants grew more quickly and took up all the room. Then the good plants couldn't grow properly and didn't produce any food."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["But some seeds fell on good ground and began to grow, and then they grew up and produced lots of food. Jesus told the people this story, and then at the end he told them these strong words. “You must think carefully about that story I have told you,” he said. “Don't let it go in one ear and out the other, but keep thinking carefully about it.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["Jesus' disciples said to him, “What does the story mean?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["Jesus said to them, “That word of God's about him becoming King was hidden at first.

He said, “Those seeds are like God's words."]},{"type":"verse","number":12,"content":["Some people hear them, but Satan comes along and takes those words away from their minds. So those people are like the seeds that fell on the path. And Satan is like the birds that take the seeds. Satan takes God's message away from people so that they won't know it and they won't believe in God, and so that God can't save them."]},{"type":"verse","number":13,"content":["“Some people hear God's message and they feel happy and accept it.

He told them about lamps and about words. He said, “When you and I light a lamp inside the house we put it up high so that people can have a good, strong light. When we light it we don't hide it, we don't put a tin on top of it and we don't hide it under a bed. We put it up high so that it lights up the whole room. Then when people come inside the house they see the light.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":17,"content":["Then Jesus went on to say, “Anything that is hidden now will be made clear later."]},{"type":"verse","number":18,"content":["So you should listen very carefully to me today and you should always obey me. “Any of you who listen carefully to me and never disobey me will keep my words in your mind all the time. And I will help you so that you can know more. If any of you think, ‘I know all those words,’ but you don't listen to them properly and don't obey them, then I won't help you. And then you will forget them all. So that is why you must listen very carefully to me today.”"]},{"type":"heading","content":["About Jesus and his brothers"]},{"type":"verse","number":19,"content":["Then Jesus' mother and his younger brothers came to the house where Jesus was staying, but they couldn't get near him because there were so many people there inside."]},{"type":"verse","number":20,"content":["Someone said to Jesus, “Your mother and your brothers are here.

They had been in him for a very long time and had grabbed hold of him many times. His people had tied his hands and feet with chains but he kept breaking them. The spirits used to drive him away into the desert and he used to go around without any clothes on. He wouldn't stay at home and he kept away from houses and people. He used to sleep in the caves where they put dead bodies. When the man came close to him, Jesus spoke to the evil spirits and said, “Come out!” But the man screamed and bowed down in front of Jesus.
