The woman went up to him and stood behind him near his feet. She stood there crying, and her tears wet his feet as they fell. Then she bent down and dried his feet with her hair and kissed them. Then she poured the beautiful oil that she had brought with her on Jesus' feet. It smelled very good. The woman was doing that because she loved Jesus and she wanted him to know that she loved him."]},{"type":"verse","number":39,"content":["The Pharisee who was the owner of the house saw what she was doing, and he said to himself, “What sort of man is this? If he is really a prophet he would know about this woman.

Then the time came for the men to give the money back to him."]},{"type":"verse","number":42,"content":["But they didn't have any money, so they couldn't pay him back. After he had waited a very long time, the man said to them, “It is all right. You needn't pay me back, because you haven't got any money. I will forget about that money.” “So tell me, Simon,” Jesus said to him. “Which of those men only loved him a little and which one loved him very much?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":43,"content":["Simon said, “I think the man who was supposed to pay back a lot of money would love him more, because he forgave him a lot more.” “That is right,” said Jesus."]},{"type":"verse","number":44,"content":["Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, “Look at this woman. When I came into your house you didn't give me any water for my feet. You didn't wash my feet for me, but this woman has washed my feet with her tears, and she has dried them with her hair."]},{"type":"verse","number":45,"content":["When I came into your house, you didn't kiss me. But this woman has kissed my feet again and again, because she loves me."]},{"type":"verse","number":46,"content":["You didn't pour any olive oil on my head so that people would know you are happy that I have come to your house. But this woman bought some expensive sweet-smelling perfume, and she has poured it over my feet."]},{"type":"verse","number":47,"content":["She knows she is a sinner, because she has done many bad things. But God has forgiven all her sins, and so she loves me very much.
