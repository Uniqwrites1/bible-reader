If we heal sick people on the Sabbath, is that good or bad?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["But they wouldn't say anything. Jesus touched the man and healed him and sent him home."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["Then Jesus said to the people, “If your son falls down a hole on the Sabbath, what do you do? And if your bullock falls down a hole on the Sabbath, what do you do? Even if it is the Sabbath, you would quickly pull your son out of the hole and you would pull your bullock out too.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["And they had nothing to say, they couldn't answer a word. They just kept quiet."]},{"type":"heading","content":["We must not be proud"]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["Jesus noticed that some people had chosen the best places to sit in, because they thought they were important. So when Jesus saw them he said,"]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["“If a man asks you to his house to eat with him, don't choose the best place to sit in. Maybe the owner of the house has invited an important man to eat with him, a more important man than you are."]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["Don't choose the best place, so that the owner of the house won't have to say to you, ‘Move away and let this man sit here.’ If he says that to you, then you will be ashamed and you will have to leave the place you have taken."]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["“So don't choose a good place but go and sit somewhere else, even if it isn't comfortable.

He said to the servant, “Go out on to the roads. Don't wait. Go quickly to other people living in this town. Go along the roads and the footpaths. Look for any people, the poor and the crippled and the blind. Bring people like that here to my house to eat this food.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":22,"content":["And the servant went off.

Listen. Let me tell you about a building and about a fight.” If a man wants to build a very high building, first of all before he starts work he has to think about it very carefully. He must count his money to see if he has enough to finish it."]},{"type":"verse","number":29,"content":["If he doesn't count his money first, maybe he will only put down the cement and nothing more. Then he can't go on with the building. Then other people will tease him."]},{"type":"verse","number":30,"content":["“Look,” they will say, “this man began to build but he can't finish his work! It is only half done.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":31,"content":["And if one king wants to fight another king, he too must think about it carefully. He will have to count his soldiers before he goes to fight.

You mustn't refuse to leave behind everything that you have.”"]},{"type":"heading","content":["About being like salt that is salty"]},{"type":"verse","number":34,"content":["Then Jesus said to the people, “You know about salt. It is really good. But when salt becomes tasteless, what can we do to make it good again? We can't do anything. We can't make it good because it is not salty."]},{"type":"verse","number":35,"content":["We will have to throw it away. We can't put it on the ground to make the soil good. And we can't mix it with bullock's manure to make the plants grow well. We can't do anything because the salt is quite useless. “So listen carefully to everything I have told you. Don't let it go in one ear and out the other, but keep on thinking carefully about it.”"]}],"footnotes":[]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_aoi/LUK/14.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_aoi/LUK/15.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_aoi/LUK/13.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":35}
