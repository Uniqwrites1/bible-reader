He had many sheep, goats and cattle and lots of silver and gold. Lot was also a rich man. He too had many sheep, goats and cattle. And he took all of them and his family and his servants with him. So they went from place to place. They went towards Bethel until they reached a place between Bethel and Ai.

The river went all the way to a place called Zoar. There was plenty of water and trees and other plants, just like the place that Yahweh made called Eden, and also like the land of Egypt. Lot wanted the land with the big Jordan valley for himself, so he went off to the east and the two men separated. Abram stayed in the land of Canaan, but Lot made his camp near the city of Sodom. The people of Sodom were wicked. They didn't obey Yahweh; they were always doing evil things. But Lot and his family stayed there, before Yahweh destroyed the two cities of Sodom and Gomorrah."]},{"type":"heading","content":["About Abram going to Hebron"]},{"type":"verse","number":14,"content":["After Lot had gone, Yahweh said to Abram, “From where you are standing, look around you,"]},{"type":"verse","number":15,"content":["because I will give this country to you and to your children.
