In the seven good years there will be plenty of food in Egypt, so they should put some of the food in storehouses. If there are five bags of food, people can eat four and put one in the storehouse. You should tell the workers to store up plenty of food in the towns. And you should tell them to guard the food so that no one can take it. It must be kept safe for later. Then when the seven bad years come in Egypt the food will still be there for everyone to eat, so that they will live and not starve to death.”"]},{"type":"heading","content":["About Joseph becoming governor of Egypt"]},{"type":"verse","number":37,"content":["The king and his officers liked what Joseph said."]},{"type":"verse","number":38,"content":["So the king said to his officers, “We will never find a man as good as Joseph, because he has God's spirit in him.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":39,"content":["Then he said to Joseph, “God has shown you all this.

It was a very good one just like the king's.

Move back for the governor!’"]},{"type":"verse","number":44,"content":["“I am the king, so everyone in Egypt must obey me. I have said to them, ‘You must all obey Joseph's orders. You must go to him and ask his permission before you do anything.’”"]},{"type":"verse","number":45,"content":["Then the king gave Joseph an Egyptian name, Zaphenath Paneah. And he gave him a wife called Asenath. She was the daughter of Potiphera, who was a priest for the Egyptian people in a city called Heliopolis.

And Joseph left the king's palace and went everywhere all over Egypt."]},{"type":"verse","number":48,"content":["He went to the cities and told the people what to do. In each city the people collected the food they had grown in the different places nearby and they stored it all in a big storehouse there in their city."]},{"type":"verse","number":49,"content":["There was so much food that Joseph couldn't measure it any more, because it was like the grains of sand on the beach."]},{"type":"verse","number":50,"content":["Then while there was still plenty of food in Egypt, Asenath and Joseph had a son. Joseph said, “God has helped me and I have forgotten all my suffering and all my father's family.” So he named his first son Manasseh, because Manasseh means “I have forgotten.” Later while there was still plenty of food, Asenath and Joseph had another son. Joseph said, “God has given me children in this land where I have had so much trouble.” So he called the child Ephraim, because Ephraim means “he has given me children.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":53,"content":["The seven good years in Egypt ended."]},{"type":"verse","number":54,"content":["Then seven bad years came, just as Joseph had said. The food didn't grow any more and people in every other country were hungry, except in Egypt where there was food in the storehouses."]},{"type":"verse","number":55,"content":["Those years got worse all over Egypt and the Egyptians began to be hungry and they went to the king. They begged him for food, but the king said to them, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.” So they all went to Joseph and he opened the storehouses and sold food to them."]},{"type":"verse","number":57,"content":["Then many people came to Egypt from other countries to buy food because they were bad years everywhere."]}],"footnotes":[]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_aoi/GEN/41.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_aoi/GEN/42.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_aoi/GEN/40.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":48}
