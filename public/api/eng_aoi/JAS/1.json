You should be very happy,"]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["because when you have any kind of trouble, you can keep on trusting God even more. When you trust in him, you will become strong so that you won't do anything wrong."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["You must keep on being strong so that you will be perfect and you won't need anything more to be good people."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["Maybe you will say to yourself, “What shall I do? What is the right thing for me to do?” Then you should say to God, “Father, what is right, and what is wrong? I don't know, so please help me to know,” because you don't know by yourself. God won't refuse, he will listen when you pray to him. He will listen to you and he will help you. He won't blame you for not knowing what to do."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["When you pray to God, you must believe that he will really listen to you and help you. If you say to God, “Please help me,” then don't think to yourself, “God won't help me.” Don't have two minds like that. Some people can't make up their minds. First they trust in God and then later they don't trust in him any longer. Those people are like the waves in the sea. The wind blows the sea this way and that way, and those people are like the sea. God doesn't help people like that to know what is right and what is wrong."]},{"type":"heading","content":["About poor people and rich people"]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["Maybe one of you who belongs to God is poor.

But God says, “You are rich but you are not important, you aren't special.” You should be happy too.

Like those flowers you too will die."]},{"type":"heading","content":["God does not tempt us to do wrong"]},{"type":"verse","number":12,"content":["You people who keep standing strong when troubles come to you, you should be happy.

So where does that wrong come from? It doesn't come from God,"]},{"type":"verse","number":14,"content":["but it is already there in your mind. That's what tempts you and nothing else. If you keep on and on thinking about it, then you will decide to do it."]},{"type":"verse","number":15,"content":["And if you keep on wanting to do wrong and you are still thinking about it all the time, then you will do it.

You should keep listening to it and obeying it and doing what is right all the time. If you do that, God will make you happy."]},{"type":"verse","number":26,"content":["One of you might say, “I obey God and I worship him.” But if you speak bad words, speaking carelessly all the time, you will not really be obeying and worshipping God. You will just be tricking yourself."]},{"type":"verse","number":27,"content":["But if any of you are obeying God properly and worshipping him, you will help other people all the time. You are the ones our Father God will see as perfect. When children are sad because their fathers and mothers have died, you will help them. When a widow is sad after her husband has died, you will help her too. You will keep working busily all the time. And if bad people tempt you to do wrong you will take no notice but keep on being good."]}],"footnotes":[]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_aoi/JAS/1.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_aoi/JAS/2.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_aoi/1TI/6.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":25}
