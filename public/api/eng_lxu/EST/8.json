Many who have been frequently honoured by the most abundant kindness of their",{"noteId":22389},"benefactors have conceived ambitious designs, and not only endeavour to hurt our subjects, but moreover, not being able to bear prosperity, they also endeavour to plot against their own benefactors. And they not only would utterly abolish gratitude from amongst men, but also, elated by the boastings of men who are strangers to all that is good, they supposed that they shall escape the sin-hating vengeance of the ever-seeing God. And oftentimes evil exhortation has made partakers of the guilt of shedding innocent blood, and has involved in irremediable calamities, many of those who had been appointed to offices of authority, who had been entrusted with the management of their friends' affairs; while men, by the false sophistry of an evil disposition, have deceived the simple candour of the ruling powers.

And it is right to take heed with regard to the future, that we may maintain the government in undisturbed peace for all men, adopting needful changes, and ever judging those cases which come under our notice, with truly equitable decision. For whereas Aman, a Macedonian, the son of Amadathes, in reality an alien from the blood of the Persians, and differing widely from our mild course of government, having been hospitable entertained by us, obtained so large a share of our universal kindness, as to be called our father, and to continue the person next to the royal throne, reverenced of all; he however,",{"noteId":22391},"overcome by the pride of his station, endeavored to deprive us of our dominion, and our",{"noteId":22392},"life: having by various and subtle artifices demanded for destruction both Mardochaeus our deliverer and perpetual benefactor, and Esther the blameless consort of our kingdom, with their whole nation.

But we find that the Jews, who have been consigned to destruction by the",{"noteId":22393},"most abominable of men, are not malefactors, but living according to the justest laws, and being the sons of the living God, the most high and",{"noteId":22394},"mighty, who maintains the kingdom. to us as well as to our forefathers, in the most excellent order. You° will therefore do well in refusing to obey the letter sent by Aman the son of Amadathes, because he that has done these things, has been hanged with his whole family at the gates of Susa, Almighty God having swiftly returned to him a worthy recompence, We enjoin you then, having openly published a copy of this letter in every place, to give the Jews permission to use their own lawful customs, and to strengthen them, that on the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar, on the self-same day, they may defend themselves against those who attack them in a time of affliction. For in the place of the destruction of the chosen race, Almighty God has granted them this time of gladness. Do you° therefore also, amongst your notable feasts, keep a distinct day with all festivity, that both now and hereafter it may be a day of deliverance to us and who are well disposed towards the Persians, but to those that plotted against us a memorial of destruction. And every city and province collectively, which shall not do accordingly, shall be consumed with vengeance by spear and fire: it shall be made not only inaccessible to men, but most hateful to wild beasts and birds for ever.] And let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom and let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies."]},{"type":"verse","number":14,"content":["So the horsemen went forth with haste to perform the king's commands; and the ordinance was also published in Susa."]},{"type":"verse","number":15,"content":["And Mardochaeus went forth robed in the royal apparel, and wearing a golden crown, and a diadem of fine purple linen: and the people in Susa saw it and rejoiced."]},{"type":"verse","number":16,"content":["And the Jews had light and gladness,"]},{"type":"verse","number":17,"content":["in every city and province wherever the ordinance was published: wherever the proclamation took place, the Jews had joy and gladness, feasting and mirth: and many of the Gentiles were circumcised, and became Jews, for fear of the Jews."]}],"footnotes":[{"noteId":22385,"caller":"+","text":"Gr. country.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":6}},{"noteId":22386,"caller":"+","text":"Or, possible","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":8}},{"noteId":22387,"caller":"+","text":"Gr. stewards.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":9}},{"noteId":22388,"caller":"+","text":"the passages in brackets are not in the Hebrew.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":13}},{"noteId":22389,"caller":"+","text":"perhaps rulers, see Luke 22. 25.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":13}},{"noteId":22390,"caller":"+","text":"Gr. contrived.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":13}},{"noteId":22391,"caller":"+","text":"Gr. not having borne.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":13}},{"noteId":22392,"caller":"+","text":"Gr. spirit.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":13}},{"noteId":22393,"caller":"+","text":"Gr. thrice guilty.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":13}},{"noteId":22394,"caller":"+","text":"Gr. greatest.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":13}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_lxu/EST/8.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_lxu/EST/9.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_lxu/EST/7.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":17}
