You might get different sorts of trouble. But don’t get upset about it. No, you can be happy about it,"]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["because it will make you strong for God. You see, if you get trouble, and if you keep on trusting God, then you will become really strong for God, and you will stay strong, even if more trouble comes."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["Then, after you learn to do that properly, you will be really strong.
