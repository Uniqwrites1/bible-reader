He said, “A man planted some fruit trees in his garden. Then he built a strong fence around it, and he made all the things he needed to look after those trees properly. Then he got some men to look after those trees for him. They agreed to give him some of the fruit from that garden, instead of paying rent money for it. After that, the owner went away to another country."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["The time came for the men to pick the fruit, and the owner sent one of his work-men to get some of his fruit from the garden."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["But the men in the garden grabbed that work-man, and they beat him up, and they sent him back with nothing."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["Then the owner sent another work-man to the garden, but those men hit him on the head and said bad things to him."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["After that, the owner sent another work-man to the garden, and this time the men killed him. Again and again the owner sent work-men to get some of his fruit, but the men in the garden killed some of them, and they beat up the others."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["The owner of the garden had one more person to send to get the fruit from the garden. The owner said to himself, ‘I will try one more time. I will send my son. I love him, and those men in the garden will respect him too.’ So he sent his son to that garden."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["But the men in the garden saw the owner’s son, and they said to themselves, ‘After that old man dies this young man will get this garden for himself. Let’s kill this man now so that we can get the garden for ourselves.’"]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["So they grabbed the young man, and they killed him and chucked his body out of the garden.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["Then Jesus asked the people, “What do you reckon the owner of that garden will do?

But they were frightened of the big mob of people there, so they just walked away and left him alone."]},{"type":"heading","content":["Some people tried to trick Jesus"]},{"type":"verse","number":13,"content":["Then the Jewish leaders sent some other men to try to trick Jesus. They sent some of the law men that were called Pharisees, and they sent some men that were good friends of Herod. Herod was the big government boss at that time. Those men tried to get Jesus to say something wrong, so they could make trouble for him."]},{"type":"verse","number":14,"content":["They said to Jesus, “Teacher, we know that you always want to do the right thing, and you always say true words. You talk to everyone the same way, people that are important and people that are not important. You always teach God’s words the right way. Well, we have a question about the Roman government bosses over our country. Is it right or wrong for us Jews to pay tax money to them?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":15,"content":["Jesus knew that if he said, “Don’t pay that tax money,” then he will be in trouble with the Roman bosses, and if he said, “Pay that tax money,” then he will be in trouble with the Jewish people.

I want to look at a coin.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":16,"content":["The men gave Jesus a coin. He looked at it and said, “Who is this on this money? Whose picture is this?

Then they have to have kids, and everyone will call those kids that dead brother’s kids.’"]},{"type":"verse","number":20,"content":["But what about this. There were 7 brothers. The oldest brother got married, but he died before his wife could have a baby."]},{"type":"verse","number":21,"content":["So the next brother married that woman to follow God’s law, but he died too, before they could have a baby. Then the next brother did the same, but he died too, before they could have a baby."]},{"type":"verse","number":22,"content":["The same happened to all of those brothers. They all followed God’s law and married the woman, but each of them died before they could have any kids. And then last of all, that woman died too."]},{"type":"verse","number":23,"content":["Well, you reckon that one day all the dead people will come alive again. So here is our question. If all those brothers and that woman come alive again, which brother will have that woman as his wife? All 7 brothers had her as their wife before they died.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":24,"content":["Jesus said, “You mob have a problem. You don’t know God’s word properly, and you don’t know about God’s power."]},{"type":"verse","number":25,"content":["You see, after all the dead people come alive again, they will be like God’s angel messengers in heaven. Those angels never marry each other. And people that come alive again will be the same. Nobody will promise a wife to anyone, and nobody will marry anyone."]},{"type":"verse","number":26,"content":["You mob reckon that dead people will never come alive again, but think about this story about Moses.

God is the number one boss over everybody. There is no other god, just him."]},{"type":"verse","number":33,"content":["We have to love God properly, not just a little bit. We have to love God from right inside ourselves. We have to love God in the way we feel, and in the way we think. And we have to love God in the way we do things. That is really important for us. It is not so important for us to do ceremonies, like we do when we burn meat to give it to God.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":34,"content":["Jesus heard the man’s words and knew this man was thinking the right way, so Jesus said, “You are right. You are nearly ready for God to take you into his family.” After that, nobody was brave enough to ask Jesus any more questions to try to trick him."]},{"type":"heading","content":["Jesus taught people in God’s special house"]},{"type":"verse","number":35,"content":["Then Jesus taught people in the yard of God’s ceremony house.

He said, “Look out for those Jewish law teachers. They think they are great. They wear real good clothes so that people will think they are important. They like people to say hello to them whenever they go shopping."]},{"type":"verse","number":39,"content":["Those law teachers want everyone to respect them, so they want to have special chairs at the meeting houses, and if they go to parties, they want to have special places to sit."]},{"type":"verse","number":40,"content":["But they do bad things. They trick old women that haven’t got anybody to look after them. They take everything off those women. They take their houses and all their things, and then those law teachers go to the meeting house and say long prayers, so that people will think they are good. They just pretend to live God’s way. You know, God will punish them more than he will punish the other people that do bad things.”"]},{"type":"heading","content":["A poor widow gave money to God"]},{"type":"verse","number":41,"content":["Then Jesus sat down near the money box at God’s ceremony house, and he watched the people put money in the box to give it to God.
