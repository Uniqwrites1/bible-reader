You see, God picked you to be his own people, so you have to live his way."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["Don’t think that you are more important than other people. You have to be good to other people, you have to listen to them and try to understand them. Don’t get angry with each other, but you have to love each other all the time."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["Try hard to let God’s spirit keep you together as friends, without any trouble between you."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["All of God’s people are like parts of one body, with the one Holy Spirit living in all of us.

So now he can be everywhere."]},{"type":"verse","number":11,"content":["And Jesus Christ gives these special gifts to his people, so that they can help other people in the church. These gifts are the powers he gives to Christians. He gave some of his people the power to be his special workers, and he sent them out to other people to tell them his good news. And he gave other Christians the power to tell God’s messages to people. And he gave some of them the power to help other people to believe in Jesus. And he gave some Christians the power to be pastors, to look after Christians and teach them God’s way. God gave all these powers to his people to get them ready, so that they can work together for him. God works like that, so that his people get stronger, and so that more people join his family.
