They will never thank anyone for anything. They will not respect things that belong to God."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["They will be hard and cruel.

Think about the story from a long time ago, that story about Jannes and Jambres. They stood up against Moses and argued with him. In the end God killed those 2 men, and everyone saw that they were fools, and that they were wrong. Well, those tricky men are just like those 2 men that lived a long time ago. Those tricky men stand up and argue against anyone that tells the true message, but in the end everyone will know that they are fools, and that they are wrong."]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["But Timothy, you are very different from them.
