I want you to be strong. And if you always stay joined up to Jesus Christ, you can do that. You see, he is always good to you, and he will help you."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["You heard me tell those true things about Jesus to lots of people, so you have to teach those things to more people. Pick good people that everyone respects, then teach them those things, so that they can go to other people and teach them those same things."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["Remember that you belong to Jesus Christ. You are like his soldier. If soldiers get hurt, they don’t stop fighting. They just forget their pain and keep going. Well, you have to be like that now. If people see that you belong to Jesus, and then they hurt you, you just have to forget it and keep going, just like a good soldier, and like other good Christians."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["And you know that soldiers don’t get other jobs while they are in the army.

He was born into the family of David, the man that was the big boss a long time ago. But people gave Jesus a lot of trouble, and they killed him. But then God made him alive again. That is the good news that I always tell people about Jesus."]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["But some of them don’t like me telling everybody that message, so they make trouble for me. They even treat me like a criminal. They tied me up and put me here in this jail. But nobody can tie up God’s word or keep it in jail. Anyone out there now can still go around and tell people God’s message."]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["So I reckon it’s all right for me to stay here in jail so that other people will hear that message and believe in Jesus.

In a big house there are lots of things that people use all the time. Some of those things are really special, like gold bowls and silver spoons, and people use those things for good clean jobs. But for dirty jobs, they use pots made from the ground, or from wood."]},{"type":"verse","number":21,"content":["Well, it is like that too with people that belong to God. If you stop doing bad things, you are like gold things or silver things, and God will use you for the good jobs. You will live in a clean way, and you will be ready for God to use you any way he wants to."]},{"type":"verse","number":22,"content":["Lots of young people just follow their own feelings, and then they do bad things. But you have to keep away from anything like that. Keep away from anything that will push you into doing something bad. Instead of that, you have to try to do good things, and always trust God, and love people, and don’t fight anyone. Some people live like that. They pray to God, and they only want to do good things. Well, make those people your good friends, and you live like that too."]},{"type":"verse","number":23,"content":["But you can’t argue about stupid things that are not important.

You know, the devil, the boss over the bad spirits, he tries to trick people. It is like he sets a trap for them. He catches people in his trap, then he makes them do whatever he wants them to do. But if you teach people properly, they can wake up, then God will help them turn around, and he will get them to think straight, and they will understand that true message, and God will get them out of the devil’s trap."]}],"footnotes":[]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_pev/2TI/2.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_pev/2TI/3.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_pev/2TI/1.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":25}
