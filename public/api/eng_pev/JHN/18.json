They went across the creek called Kidron, and they went to a garden."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["Judas wasn’t with them because, before this time, he turned against Jesus, and that night he went to the Jewish leaders to help them grab him. He knew that Jesus and his special workers went to that garden lots of times."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["So Judas went to that garden with some soldiers to show them where Jesus was. He got those soldiers from the bosses of the Jewish ceremonies and the Pharisee mob. And there were some Roman soldiers with him too. They had fire sticks, and spears, and long knives with them."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["Jesus knew everything that was going to happen to him, but he went to meet them anyway. Then Jesus said to that mob, “Who are you looking for?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["They said, “We are looking for Jesus, the man from Nazareth.” Jesus said, “I am Jesus.” As soon as Jesus said that, all the soldiers moved backwards and fell down to the ground.

Then they all got to the house that belonged to Annas. He was a boss of the Jewish ceremonies. That other follower went into the yard of that house with the rest of the mob. You see, that other follower knew that ceremony boss, so the girl that looked after the gate let him go in, but Peter had to wait outside.

I talked in our meeting houses, and in God’s ceremony house in Jerusalem, the places where all of us Jewish people meet.

I am not his follower.” Then straight away, a chook yelled out."]},{"type":"heading","content":["They took Jesus to Pilate, the Roman boss"]},{"type":"verse","number":28,"content":["It was early in the morning, and they took Jesus from Cayafas’s house to the house of the government boss in Jerusalem. His name was Pilate. It was the time of the Passover ceremony, so the Jewish leaders wouldn’t go into that house. You see, in their Jewish culture, if they went into a house that belonged to somebody that wasn’t Jewish, it was like they became dirty, and then they couldn’t eat the Passover food."]},{"type":"verse","number":29,"content":["So the Jewish leaders stayed outside, and Pilate went out to talk to them. He said, “Why did you bring this man here? What bad thing did he do?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":30,"content":["The Jewish leaders said, “He did really bad things. That’s the reason why we brought him to you.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":31,"content":["Pilate said to them, “Take him away and judge him by your own laws.” The Jewish leaders said, “Your Roman laws will not let us kill anyone to punish them.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":32,"content":["You see, they had to say that because Jesus said that he was going to die on a cross, and that’s how the Romans punished people."]},{"type":"verse","number":33,"content":["Pilate went back into his house, and he called Jesus to come to him. Then he asked Jesus, “Are you the big boss over the Jewish nation?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":34,"content":["Jesus said, “Did you think of that question yourself, or did somebody else tell you about me?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":35,"content":["Pilate said, “I am not a Jew, so I don’t know anything about you mob.

What did you do?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":36,"content":["Jesus said, “I am a big boss, but I am not the big boss over a nation here in this world. That is the reason why my followers didn’t fight to stop the Jewish leaders from grabbing me.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":37,"content":["Then Pilate said, “So it is true that you are a big boss?” Jesus said, “Yes, you said that I am a big boss, and you are right.

If anyone really wants to know the true message, they take notice of the things I say.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":38,"content":["Pilate said, “Do you think you know the true message? Nobody knows that.” Then Pilate went outside again, to talk to the Jewish leaders.

Do you want me to let this man, your big boss, go free?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":40,"content":["All the Jewish leaders shouted back, “No, not him.
