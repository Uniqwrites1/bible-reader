You know, we taught you about the right way to live, to make God happy. And you have been living that way. That’s good. But we want you to live like that even more."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["You know the things that we told you to do. Our leader, Jesus, got us to tell you those things."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["This is what God wants. He wants you to be properly good and to keep away from everything that is wrong. If somebody is not your own wife or husband, don’t sleep with them as if you are married to them."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["Every one of you has to learn how to control your own body in a way that is clean and good."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["Don’t be like people that don’t know God. They just want to sleep with anybody and do the wrong thing with them. That is what they want to do, and they are always thinking about it. They don’t try to stop themselves. Don’t be like that."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["None of you men can ever sleep with a woman that is not your own wife. If you do that, you are doing a bad thing to her husband. He is the only person that can sleep with her, so don’t cheat him out of that. Don’t do that bad thing to another Christian, or to anyone else. God is the one that will punish you if you do that. We told you about that when we were with you, and we mean it."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["God picked us to be his people, but he didn’t pick us to be people that do bad and dirty things, like sleeping with somebody else’s wife or husband.

And don’t be lazy, but work to get enough money to buy whatever you need."]},{"type":"verse","number":12,"content":["Then you will not have to ask other people for things.

We don’t want you to be sad when you think about them. Other people, that don’t believe in Jesus, they don’t know what will happen to them after they die. So when their friends die, they get really sad. But if our Christian friends die, we don’t have to be really sad like those other people. Listen, we want you to understand this properly."]},{"type":"verse","number":14,"content":["You see, we believe that Jesus died, and after that, God made him alive again.

Those of us that are still alive when Jesus comes back, we will not go and meet him before the Christians that already died."]},{"type":"verse","number":16,"content":["It will happen like this. Our leader, Jesus himself, will come down from heaven, and while he is coming, everyone will hear him call out, and they will hear the voice of the boss angel, and they will hear the sound of God’s trumpet. Then, first of all, those people that belonged to Jesus Christ and already died, they will come back to life."]},{"type":"verse","number":17,"content":["After that, God will get those of us Christians that are still alive at that time, and he will take us up into the clouds with the Christians that already died, and we will all meet Jesus, our leader, way up in the air.
