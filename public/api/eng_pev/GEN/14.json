There were 5 tribes in that flat country at that time, and each tribe had a leader. These were the 5 tribes and their leaders, – A tribe called Sodom, and their leader was called Bera. – A tribe called Gomorrah, and their leader was called Birsha. – A tribe called Admah, and their leader was Shinab. – A tribe called the Zebo mob, and their leader was Shemeber. – A tribe called Zoar. They are also called Bela. There were another 4 tribes in the country to the east. These were those 4 tribes and their leaders, – A tribe called Elam, and their leader was Kedorlayomer. – A tribe called Babylonia, and their leader was called Amrafel. – A tribe called Ellasar, and their leader was called Ariok. – A tribe called the Goy mob, and their leader was Tidal. And Kedorlayomer was the boss over those 4 tribes in the east. Those 4 tribes sent their soldiers to fight the other 5 tribes, and the 4 tribes from the east won. So Kedorlayomer became the boss over the other 5 tribes too. Those 5 tribes let him be their boss for 12 years. Then the next year, their leaders told Kedorlayomer that they didn’t want him to be their boss any more. Kedorlayomer got really angry, and the next year, he got soldiers from the 4 tribes in the east, and they went to fight those 5 tribes. On the way to that fight, Kedorlayomer’s soldiers had other fights with some other tribes, and they won all those fights. They beat the Refa tribe at a place called Ashteroth-Karnayim, and they beat the Zuz tribe at a place called Ham, and they beat the Em tribe at a place called Shaveh-Kiriathayim, and they beat the Hor tribe in the hill country called Edom. They chased the Hor soldiers all the way to a place called El-Paran, near the desert. Then Kedorlayomer and the soldiers from the east, they all went back to a place called En-Mishpat. Another name for that place is Kadesh. Then Kedorlayomer and his mob fought the Amalek tribe and beat them, and took control of their country. Then they fought the Amor tribe in Hazazon-Tamar country, and beat them too. While Kedorlayomer and his mob were fighting those other people, the 5 tribes that didn’t want Kedorlayomer to be their boss, they went to the valley called Sidim. (Today there is salt water in that valley, and we call it the Dead Sea.) The soldiers of those 5 tribes got ready there to fight against Kedorlayomer and his 4 tribes from the east. So when Kedorlayomer and his mob got to that Sidim valley there was a big fight."]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["Kedorlayomer and his mob won that fight. They beat those 5 tribes, and their soldiers all ran away. In that flat country there were lots of holes in the ground that were full of sticky black stuff, called tar.

But the rest of them ran up into the hills."]},{"type":"verse","number":11,"content":["So Kedorlayomer and his soldiers went to Sodom and Gomorrah, and they grabbed all the people that lived there.

Mamreh and his brothers belonged to the Amor tribe, and Abram belonged to the Hebrew tribe, but they all looked after each other. Abram had 318 men that knew how to fight. They worked for Abram all their lives, and Abram really trusted them.
