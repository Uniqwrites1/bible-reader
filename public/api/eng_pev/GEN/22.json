He called him Israel. – God took Jacob and his family to live in Egypt. – They lived in Egypt for about 400 years, and became the nation called Israel. The families that came from his 12 sons became the 12 tribes in the Israel nation. – Then God got an Israel man, called Moses, to take the Israel nation out of Egypt, into desert country, and God gave Moses his law for those people. – After that, God gave them the country called Canaan. Today we call that country Israel. Sometimes we call the Israel people the Jewish people, or just the Jews.)"]}],"footnotes":[]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_pev/GEN/22.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_pev/MRK/1.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_pev/GEN/21.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":19}
