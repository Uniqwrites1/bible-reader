There was an old man with a young son, and that old man was sick and going to die. He knew that after he dies that little kid will get everything he owns, but the kid will not know how to look after it. So the old man got some people to be the bosses, and they agreed to look after his things until the boy grows up. He told them how old the boy has to be before he can take over and control those things. After they agreed to that, the old man died. Then that kid owned everything that his father left, but that kid couldn’t do anything with it. He was no different from his father’s workers."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["He had to do what his teachers and the other bosses told him to do, until he grew up.

That 2nd son came from the free woman."]},{"type":"verse","number":24,"content":["That old story teaches us something else too.
