Make sure you talk to that person in a good and easy way. Remember, Satan tries to get you to do bad things too, so be careful."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["You have to do this to help each other be strong. You have to help other Christians that have problems. If you do that, you will be doing what Jesus Christ told you to do."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["Don’t think that you are too important to help other Christians. If you are not very important, but you reckon you are really important, then you are just tricking yourself."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["Each one of you has to think about the things that you do, and see if those things are good, or not good.

Nobody can ever trick God, so don’t ever think you can do that. I’ll tell you a picture story about seeds. A gardener plants different sorts of seeds in his garden, then later he gets the food from the plants that grow from those seeds. Whatever sort of seed he plants, that’s the sort of food he gets."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["Well, it is like that with us people. Some people do good things, like a gardener that plants the seeds of good plants. And some people do bad things, like a gardener that plants rubbish seeds. Some people only think about what will make them feel good, so they do bad things. Later God will pay them with something bad. They will die. But other people listen to God’s spirit and do good things. Later God will do something good for them. God’s spirit will let them live with him for ever."]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["So we have to keep going the right way.
