If we love people, we will not be jealous of them. If we love people, we will not reckon we are better than they are, and we will not think we are really good when we are not good."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["If we love people, we will not be rude to them or shame them. If we love people, we will think about what they want, not just what we want for ourselves.

But we can’t stop loving people. If you love somebody properly, you will always love them. But the time will come when God will not need to give us special power any more. When that time comes, God will not tell people his special messages, and God will not get people to talk in special languages, and God will not let people know special things."]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["You see, now we only know a little bit, and the special messages that we get from God only tell us a little bit."]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["Right now we only have a little bit of what God wants to give to us.

When I was a little kid I talked like a little kid, and I thought about things the way a little kid thinks about things. I only understood what a little kid can understand. But then I grew up, and now I’m a man, and I’ve stopped thinking like a little kid."]},{"type":"verse","number":12,"content":["This is what that story means. Now we only understand a little bit. It is like we are looking at things in a dark mirror now. But the time will come when everything will be clear to us, like we are looking straight at them, not in a mirror. Right now we only know a little bit, but at that time we will know everything properly, just like God knows us properly."]},{"type":"verse","number":13,"content":["So I’m saying there are 3 important things for us to keep on doing. – We have to keep on believing in God. – We have to keep on knowing for sure that God will be good to us. – We have to keep on loving God and people. We have to keep on doing those 3 things, and the most important one is this, – We have to keep on loving God and people."]}],"footnotes":[]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_pev/1CO/13.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_pev/1CO/14.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_pev/1CO/12.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":13}
