A long time ago, they all followed Moses and walked out into the hot dry country. And God put a big cloud above them, and that cloud showed them where to go. Then they came to the Red Sea, and God pushed the water back so that they all walked through the Red Sea on dry ground."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["It was like God baptised everyone that followed Moses, at first in the cloud, and then in the sea."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["They all ate the food that God gave them,"]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["and they all drank the water that God gave them. He used his power to put a special rock there for them, and water came from that rock, and they drank it. And that rock followed them all the time in that dry country. That special rock was really Jesus Christ. He went along with them."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["That’s how God helped the people. But later most of them went wrong, and he was not happy with them. So he killed them, and their bodies lay everywhere in that dry country."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["All those things happened to the Israel people to show us that God is not happy with people that do bad things. Those things happened so that we will not want to do bad things, like they did."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["Don’t do what some of them did. They showed respect to statues that they thought were gods. God says this in his book,",{"text":"“The people sat down to eat and to drink, to show respect to those statues.

So God killed 23,000 of them in one day. This story tells us that we can only sleep with our own wife or husband, not with anybody else."]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["And some of them tried to test God. They tried to see how far wrong they could go before he punished them. And he did punish them. Cheeky snakes came and killed them. This story tells us that we can’t try to test Jesus Christ."]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["And some of them complained about God and said that he was not fair, and one of God’s angel messengers came and killed them. This story tells us that we can’t complain about God and say he is not fair."]},{"type":"verse","number":11,"content":["All those things happened to that mob a long time ago, and God got his men to write it all in his book, to show us that those things are wrong. We have to think about those stories and learn from them. You see, we’re living in the end time now, and soon Jesus will come back."]},{"type":"verse","number":12,"content":["So be careful. If you think you are standing strong for Jesus, look out. You might fall down and go wrong."]},{"type":"verse","number":13,"content":["Sometimes you will want to do bad things and you will find it hard to stop yourself, but remember that other people find it hard to stop themselves from doing bad things too.

We all drink from that cup, and we remember that Jesus Christ died for us, and his blood came out, and we thank God for him. That joins us together with him and with each other. And when we break up the flat damper and eat it, we all remember that Jesus Christ’s body got broken for us.

They give animals to God and cook their meat on a special table. They show respect to God as they eat that meat, and that joins them together with God and with each other."]},{"type":"verse","number":19,"content":["You see, this is what I’m saying. Those statues that people think are gods, they are really nothing. And if people give food to those statues, that food doesn’t get any power at all."]},{"type":"verse","number":20,"content":["Really, those people are showing respect to bad spirits, not God, and they are joining themselves to bad spirits. Don’t do that. I don’t want you to join up with bad spirits."]},{"type":"verse","number":21,"content":["You can’t go 2 ways at the same time.

We can do anything we like. We can eat that food that they give to those statues, and it will not hurt us.” All right, but I’m telling you, “No. Not everything is good for us Christians to do.” And you might reckon, “We are free, so we can do anything.” But I’m telling you, “No. Not everything helps us be better Christians.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":24,"content":["Don’t just think about yourself, and what is good for you, but think about what is good for other people."]},{"type":"verse","number":25,"content":["So, all right, this is what you can do. You can buy food from anyone that sells it, but don’t ask them if they first gave it to one of those statues.

Don’t eat that food. Think about the person that told you about it.

So, if I eat that food, nobody can blame me when I eat it.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":31,"content":["Don’t think like that.
