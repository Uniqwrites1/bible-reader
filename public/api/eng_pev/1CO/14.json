That is more important than the power to talk in a special language."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["If somebody talks in a special language, they are only talking to God, not talking to people. Nobody can understand them. The Holy Spirit is getting them to talk about secret things, but nobody can understand what they are saying."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["But if somebody tells messages from God, they are talking to other people, and helping them to understand things better and get strong. Those messages from God help people and make them happy, even if they have trouble."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["You see, a person that talks in a special language helps only themselves. But a person that tells messages from God helps all the people in the church to get strong."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["I’m happy if you all talk in special languages, but I’m more happy if you all tell people messages from God.

They will help the church get strong."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["My Christian friends, if I come and talk to you in a special language that you don’t understand, that will not help you. But if God shows me something, and if I tell you about it, that will help you. Or if he lets me know something new, and if I tell you about it, that will help you too. Or if he gives me a message for you, and if I come and tell you, or if I teach you something, that will help you too."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["Think about things that make sounds, like guitars. If we don’t play them the right way, nobody will think it is proper music."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["And think about soldiers.

You have to talk clearly and say words that people can understand.

If you talk in special languages, God will use that talk, but not the way you think. He will use it to show you that it is useless to do that when you are all together in a church meeting. Suppose some strangers come into that meeting, people that don’t know very much, and don’t believe in God. They will hear you all talking in those strange languages, and they will say, “You mob are all mad.” But if you tell God’s special messages, God will use that to show you that it is right to do that in your church meetings. Suppose some strangers come into the meeting, and they hear you telling messages from God. They will listen to what you say, and they will understand it. Then they will know that they are not God’s friends, and they will know that they have to turn around and stop doing bad things."]},{"type":"verse","number":25,"content":["Those messages from God will show them every secret thing that they think about, and they will get down on the ground and show respect to God.

Whenever you church people meet together, each one of you can have something to help the other people there. One of you might have a song that all of you can sing to God. Another person might have something that they can teach you. Somebody else might want to tell you about something that God has shown them. Another person might talk in a special language, and then somebody else can tell everybody what those words in that special language mean. Do all those things to help each other be strong Christians."]},{"type":"verse","number":27,"content":["Only let 2 or 3 people talk in special languages in your meetings, and they have to take turns. Only let one person talk at a time, and then, each time, somebody has to tell everybody what those words in that special language mean."]},{"type":"verse","number":28,"content":["But if there is nobody there that can do that, then don’t let anybody talk in special languages.

All right, but they have to understand that this letter I’m writing comes from our leader himself, and his people have to do what he says."]},{"type":"verse","number":38,"content":["So if that person will not take any notice of this letter, then you mob can’t believe their messages.
