I will kill the other bull and cut it in pieces and lay the pieces on the altar that I make."]},{"type":"verse","number":24,"content":["Then they must call to their god [MTY], and I will call to Yahweh.

He said, “Surely Baal is a god, so it seems that you must shout louder! Perhaps he is thinking about something, or perhaps he has gone to the toilet. Or perhaps he is traveling somewhere, or perhaps he is asleep and you need to wake him up!”"]},{"type":"verse","number":28,"content":["So they shouted louder.

As I extend my arm, the cloud is about the size of my hand/fist.” Then Elijah shouted to him, “Go and tell King Ahab to get his chariot ready and go home immediately! If he does not do that, the rain will stop him!”"]},{"type":"verse","number":45,"content":["Very soon the sky was full of black clouds. There was a strong wind, and then it began to rain very hard.
