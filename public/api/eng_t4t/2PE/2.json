They will enter your congregations without you realizing what/who they are, and they will spiritually injure some people by what they teach. Specifically, these teachers will even deny that the Lord Jesus died to pay for the guilt of our sins. As a result, they will soon destroy themselves spiritually, and God will also punish them."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["And many people will behave in an extremely immoral manner, imitating the extremely immoral way these teachers who teach false things behave. As a result, unbelievers will ◄discredit the true message/say the true message is false►."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["Because the teachers of false teaching want a lot of things that other people have, they think that by telling you stories that they themselves have ◄made up/invented►, they will get money from you.

Those teachers of false teachings despise all beings who rule over them. Because those teachers of false doctrine will behave wickedly and will entice people to do the same things that they do, God will destroy them. 2 Peter 2:10d-16 Because those teachers of false doctrines are extremely arrogant/proud [DOU], they ◄are not afraid to insult/boldly speak evil about► glorious beings in heaven (OR, glorious/wonderful beings who rule over people)."]},{"type":"verse","number":11,"content":["In contrast, angels do not insult those teachers when those teachers accuse the angels of blasphemy while the Lord God is watching, even though the angels are much more powerful [DOU] than the teachers of false doctrines."]},{"type":"verse","number":12,"content":["Because those teachers of false doctrines are like animals that cannot think as humans do [DOU], they say evil things about spiritual things which they know nothing about.

Because of their ever-increasing ◄greed/desire to have more and more things►, they are doomed to eternal punishment."]},{"type":"verse","number":15,"content":["They have ◄rejected good moral standards/quit doing what everyone knows is right►.
