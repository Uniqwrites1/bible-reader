God showed that he had truly sent Jesus when Jesus was baptized in water [MTY] and when Jesus’ blood flowed from his body when he died. God showed this not only when Jesus was baptized [MTY], but also when Jesus’ blood flowed from his body when he died. And God’s Spirit declares truthfully that Jesus Christ came from God. The Spirit always speaks what is true."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["There are three ways by which we know that Christ came from God."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["Those three ways are: What God’s Spirit tells us, what God said when Jesus was baptized [MTY] in/with water, and Jesus’ blood that flowed from his body when he died on the cross.
