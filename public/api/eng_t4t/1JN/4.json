So do not trust every message that someone claims/says that God’s Spirit [MTY] gave to him. Instead, ◄test/think carefully about► the teachings that you hear in order to know whether they are from God or not."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["I will tell you how to recognize teachings that come from the Spirit of God: Those who affirm/say that Jesus Christ came from God to become a human like us are teaching a message that is from God."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["But those who do not affirm/say that about Jesus are not teaching a message from God.
