Then some birds came and ate those seeds."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["Other seeds fell on ground where there was not much soil on top of rock. Very soon the seeds sprouted because the sun warmed the moist soil quickly where it was not deep."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["But after the sun shone on those young plants, they became scorched. Then they withered because they did not have deep roots."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["As the farmer sowed, other seeds fell on ground that contained roots of thorny plants. The seeds grew, but the thorny plants also grew up and crowded out the good plants. So the plants produced no grain."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["But as the farmer sowed, other seeds fell on good soil. As a result, they sprouted, they grew well, and then they produced plenty of grain. Some plants bore 30 grains. Some bore 60 grains. Some bore 100 grains.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["Then Jesus said, “If you want to understand this [MTY], you should consider carefully what I have just said.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["Later, when only the twelve disciples and a few other people were with him, they asked him about the parables."]},{"type":"verse","number":11,"content":["He said to them, “People have not understood before the new message about how God wants to rule people’s lives. It is to you that this is being made known {that I am making this known}. But I tell about this only ◄in parables/figuratively► to those who have not yet invited God to rule their lives."]},{"type":"verse","number":12,"content":["As a result it is true what a prophet has written, Although they see what I do, they do not perceive what it means [DOU].
