Before God took him away, he testified that Enoch pleased him well."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["It is possible for people to please God only if they trust God, because anyone who wants to come to God must first believe that God exists and that he rewards those who seek to know him."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["It was because Noah trusted God that after he was warned by God {after God warned him} about a flood that had not yet happened, Noah showed that he revered God by building a huge ship to save his family.
