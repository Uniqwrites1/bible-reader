Instead, we must proceed to the teaching that will make us spiritually mature [MTY]. We must not be people who always need someone to teach them the elementary truths about Christ that are like [MET] a foundation. I am referring to the teaching that people who do sinful things must turn away from their sinful behavior, things that those who are spiritually [MET] dead do. I am referring to the teaching that people must believe in God."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["I am referring to the teaching about what various Jewish and Christian rituals for purifying people signify. I am referring to the teaching about how elders enable people to receive spiritual gifts by laying hands on them [MTY]. I am referring to the teaching that God will ◄cause those who have died to live again/raise people from the dead►. And I am referring to the teaching that God will judge some people and punish them eternally."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["Instead of continuing to discuss these elementary truths, we (inc) (OR, I) will go on to give people mature teaching, if God allows it."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["I will explain why it is important to do that. Some people have at one time fully understood the message about Christ [MET]. They have experienced a relationship with Jesus Christ that God [EUP/MTY] gave to them. They have received the Holy Spirit the same as others have."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["They have experienced that God’s message is good. And by what they have experienced now, they know how God will work powerfully in the future. If those people reject the message about Christ, it will not be possible for anyone to persuade them to turn away from their sinful behavior again!"]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["What those believers who later renounce the message about Christ do is as though [MET] they themselves are nailing the Son of God to a cross again! They are causing others to publicly despise Christ."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["Think about this: It is land on which rain has frequently fallen [PRS] and on which plants grow [PRS] that is useful for the people who prepare the land that God has blessed. Similarly, it is those believers who have received many good things from God and who do good deeds/things that please God, whom God will bless [MET]."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["But what will happen to believers who do deeds/things that do not please God will be like what happens to land on which only thorns and thistles grow [MET]. Such land is worthless. It has almost become land that God will curse, and eventually he will burn its vegetation [MTY]."]},{"type":"heading","content":["But God will not overlook all you have done for him."]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["Although I am writing to you like this as a warning, I am certain concerning you whom I love that you are doing better than that.

Namely, he promised to bless us, and he solemnly declared that he would declare himself guilty if he did not bless us. We know that God, who did those things, cannot lie. We have fled to him in order that we might continue confidently to expect to receive what he promised us."]},{"type":"verse","number":19,"content":["Our confidently expecting [SYN] to receive what he has promised is like an anchor [MET] that very firmly [DOU] holds us fast.
