So you should not [RHQ] keep feeling sad about what he has done. Put some olive oil in a small container and go to Bethlehem to anoint someone with the oil, and appoint him to be king. I am sending you there to a man named Jesse, because I have chosen one of his sons to be the king of Israel.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["But Samuel said, “I am afraid [RHQ] to do that! If Saul hears about it, he will kill me!” Yahweh said, “Take a ◄heifer/young female cow► with you, and say to people that you have come to kill it and offer it as a sacrifice to me."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["“Invite Jesse to come to the sacrifice.
