Then he sent the other soldiers back home. Of the men he chose, 2,000 stayed with Saul at Micmash and in the hilly area near Bethel, and 1,000 stayed with Saul’s son Jonathan at Gibeah, in the area where the descendants of Benjamin lived."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["Jonathan and the men who were with him attacked the Philistine soldiers who were camped at Geba. The other Philistines heard about that. So Saul realized that the army of Philistia would probably come to fight the Israelis again.

The Philistines had 3,000 chariots, and 6,000 chariot-drivers. Their soldiers seemed to be as many as grains of sand on the seashore [HYP]. They went up and set up their tents at Micmash, to the east of Beth-Aven (which means ‘house of wickedness’, and really referred to Bethel town)."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["The Philistines attacked the Israelis very strongly, and the Israeli soldiers realized that they were in a very bad situation.

Then they went to the area where the descendants of Gad lived and to the Gilead region. But Saul stayed at Gilgal. All the soldiers who were with him were shaking because they were so afraid."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["Saul waited seven days, which was the number of days that Samuel had told him to wait for him.
