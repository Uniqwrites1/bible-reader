Why is he trying to kill me?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["Jonathan replied, “My father is surely not trying to kill you! He always tells me before he does anything that he is planning. He tells me about important things and unimportant things that he plans to do. ◄Why would he refuse to tell me if he were planning to kill me?/I am sure that he would not refuse to tell me if he were planning to kill you.► [RHQ] So what you are saying cannot be true.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["Then David solemnly declared this to Jonathan: “Your father knows very well that you and I are very good friends, so he says to himself, ‘I will not tell Jonathan what I am going to do.
