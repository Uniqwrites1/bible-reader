I was standing alongside the Ulai Canal."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["I looked up and saw a ram that was standing alongside the canal. It had two long horns, but the newest one was longer than the other one."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["The ram butted/knocked away with its horns everything that was west and everything that was north and everything that was south of it. There were no other animals that were able to oppose it, and none that could rescue/save other animals from its power. The ram did whatever it wanted to do and became very powerful."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["While I was thinking about what I had seen, in the vision I saw a goat come from the west. It ran across the land so quickly, that it seemed like its feet did not touch the ground.

Everything that he did was successful."]},{"type":"verse","number":13,"content":["Then I heard two angels who were talking to each other. One of them asked, “How long will the things/events that were in this vision continue?

He will also be very fierce and very deceitful."]},{"type":"verse","number":24,"content":["He will become very powerful, but it will not be because of what he himself does.

He will be proud of himself. He will destroy many people when they think that they are safe. He will also rebel against God [EUP], who is the greatest king. But God will destroy him, without the help [MTY] of any human being."]},{"type":"verse","number":26,"content":["What you saw in the vision about priests being prevented from making sacrifices in the morning and in the evening, which I explained to you, will surely happen. But for the present time, do not reveal the vision to others, because it will be many years before those things happen.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":27,"content":["Then I, Daniel, became weak, and I was sick for several days.
