He did not baptize people; it was we his disciples who were doing the baptizing. But when some of the Pharisee religious group heard people say that Jesus was making more disciples than John the Baptizer and was baptizing them, they became very jealous."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["When the Lord Jesus heard about that, so that the Pharisees would not cause trouble for him, he left Judea district, and went again with us disciples to Galilee district."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["He knew that God wanted him to travel through Samaria district."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["So we arrived at a town named Sychar in Samaria district. That was near the plot of ground that our ancestor Jacob had given to his son Joseph long ago."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["The well that used to belong to Jacob was on that plot of ground. Jesus was tired from walking. So while we disciples went into the town to buy some food, he sat down alongside the well. It was about noontime. A woman who lived there in Samaria came to get some water from the well. Jesus said to her, “Will you give me from the well some water to drink?” The woman knew that Jews did not like ◄to touch things that belong to Samaritans/to come near Samaritans►, (OR, Jews did not like to associate with Samaritans,)"]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["so the woman said to him, “You are a Jew, and I am from Samaria.

So ◄I am surprised that you are asking me for a drink of water!/how is it that you are asking me for a drink of water?► [RHQ]”"]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["Jesus replied to her, “If you (sg) knew what God wanted to give you, and if you knew who I am, the one who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked me, and I would have given you water that gives life.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":11,"content":["She thought he was talking about ordinary water. So she said to him, “Sir, you do not have a bucket or a rope with which to get water from the well, and the well is deep. So since you cannot get water from this well, where can you get that life-giving water?"]},{"type":"verse","number":12,"content":["Our ancestor Jacob left us this well. He drank water from it, and there was enough good water so that his sons and his flocks of sheep and goats drank from it also. Do you claim that you are greater than Jacob, and because of that you can give us life-giving water?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":13,"content":["Jesus replied to her, “Everyone who drinks water from this well will later become thirsty again."]},{"type":"verse","number":14,"content":["But those who drink the water that I will give them will never be thirsty again.

However, none of us asked her, “What do you want?” and none of us asked him, “Why are you talking with her?”"]},{"type":"verse","number":28,"content":["The woman left her water jar there and went into the town.

God says, ‘They are ready to accept my message [MET], like crops in fields that are ready for people to harvest."]},{"type":"verse","number":36,"content":["If you help them to accept my message, I will reward you [MET], as an owner of a field pays those who harvest the crops. Because of your work, people will gain eternal life.’ I have been telling people God’s message. That is like [MET] a man who plants seeds. You will help people to accept my message. That will be like [MET] harvesting crops. When that happens, both you and I will rejoice."]},{"type":"verse","number":37,"content":["As a result, this saying will become true: One person plants seeds, but others harvest the crops."]},{"type":"verse","number":38,"content":["I am sending you to enable people to accept my message, but you will not be the first ones who tell them God’s message. Others previously worked hard to tell people God’s message, and now you will be harvesting the results of their work.”"]},{"type":"heading","content":["Many Samaritans believed that Jesus was the Messiah."]},{"type":"verse","number":39,"content":["Many of the Samaria district people who lived in that town believed that Jesus was the Messiah because they heard what that woman said about Jesus, “That man was able to tell me all about my past life [HYP]!”"]},{"type":"verse","number":40,"content":["So when those people of Samaria came to Jesus, they urged him to stay with them.
