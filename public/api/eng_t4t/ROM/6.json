We must keep remembering that it is as though our former sinful nature has ceased to function, and it is as though we have become unresponsive to sinful desires, living in a new way. So do not let the desire to commit sin control you. Instead, present yourselves to God to do righteous things."]},{"type":"verse","number":1,"content":["Someone might [RHQ] say in reply to what I have written that since God acted kindly toward us in a way we did not deserve because we sinned, perhaps we should continue to sin in order that he may continue to act even more kindly toward us and keep on forgiving us! [RHQ]"]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["I would reply, No, certainly not! We ought to consider that our sinful desires [MET] cannot make us do what they want us to do, just like we cannot make a corpse do what we want it to do. So it is not right that we continue to sin! [RHQ]"]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["When we were baptized {asked someone to baptize us} in order to show that we have a relationship with (OR, are united to) Jesus Christ, our being baptized was to declare that it was as though we died with Christ. ◄I want you to remember that!/Do you not know that?► [RHQ]"]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["So, when we were baptized {someone baptized us}, it was as though we were buried with Christ. We were baptized in order to indicate that we would not let our sinful desires make us do what they want us to do, just like people cannot make a corpse do what they want it to do [MET]. We were baptized to signify that we would continually conduct our lives in a new way, just like Christ was caused to live again in a new way by the great power of God his Father."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["Because of our close relationship with Christ, we have separated ourselves from the former way in which we conducted our lives, just like he was separated from his physical life when he died [MET]. But God will also certainly enable us to live in a new way, just like he enabled Christ to live again."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["We must keep remembering that when Christ died on the cross [MET], it was as though our sinful nature died with him. It has lost its power to make us do what it wants us to do [MET]. That happened in order that we would not do the sinful things that our bodies [MET], which desire to sin, want us to do, and in order that we would no longer have to sin [MET], as slaves have to do what their masters want."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["We are, as it were, freed {free} from sinful desires [MET] controlling us, just like those who have died are free from anything controlling them."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["Since it is as though we died with Christ, we believe that we will continue to live with him."]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["We know that since God enabled Christ to live again after he died, Christ will never die again.

In the past you willingly did the immoral and unlawful things that your minds compelled your bodies to do [MET], just like slaves do what their masters compel them to do. As a result, you did even more unlawful things. Now, you need to willingly allow your minds to compel your bodies to act righteously [MET], in order that you will behave in a holy/pure way."]},{"type":"verse","number":20,"content":["When you were like slaves because your sinful desires compelled you to do sinful things [MET], you were not concerned about behaving righteously [MET]."]},{"type":"verse","number":21,"content":["Nevertheless, doing those things resulted in your being separated from God, so you did not benefit at all from doing the sinful things that you are now ashamed of.
