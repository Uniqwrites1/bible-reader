Also, we rejoice because we are confidently expecting that God will gladly show us how great he is."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["We rejoice even when we suffer as a result of our trusting in Christ, because we know that when we are suffering, the result is that we learn to endure things patiently."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["And we know that when we endure things patiently, the result is that God approves of us.

The result of one man, Adam, sinning was that many/all people have died. But it is certain, however, that many people have abundantly experienced God’s acting kindly toward them in a way they did not deserve. It is also certain that they have experienced God’s erasing the record of their sins as the result of one man, Jesus Christ, acting kindly toward them/towards them in a way they did not deserve."]},{"type":"verse","number":16,"content":["And there is another way in which God’s freely erasing the record of our sins is not like the results of Adam’s sinning. One person, Adam, sinned. As a result, God declared that all people deserve to be punished. Many people sinned. But what God did was that he erased the record of their sins without their earning it."]},{"type":"verse","number":17,"content":["All people die [MET, PRS] because of what one man, Adam, did. But now many of us experience that God has abundantly acted towards us in ways we did not deserve, and we experience that he has erased the record of our sins without our earning it. It is also very certain that we will rule with Christ (OR, share the glory of Christ’s being king), in heaven.
