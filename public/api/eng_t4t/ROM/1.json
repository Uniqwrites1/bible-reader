As to his Son’s physical/human nature, he was born a descendant of King David."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["As to his divine nature, it was shown {God showed} powerfully that he is ◄God’s own Son/the man who is also God►. God showed this by his Holy Spirit causing him to become alive again after he died. He is Jesus Christ our Lord."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["He is the one who appointed me, who did not deserve it, to be an apostle. He did that in order that many among the non-Jews would honor him and would obey him as a result of their believing my message about him."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["You believers who are living in Rome city are included among those whom God has chosen to belong to Jesus Christ."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["I am writing this letter to all of you in Rome whom God loves and whom he has chosen to become his people. I pray that God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord will continue to act kindly toward you and will continue to cause you to have inner peace."]},{"type":"heading","content":["I thank God that people everywhere are talking about how you believers in Rome are trusting Jesus Christ. I pray that God will permit me to visit you soon. I want you to know that I have longed to visit you, but things have always prevented me from doing that. I am eager to proclaim the gospel to you who are living at Rome also."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["As I begin this letter, I thank my God for all you believers in Rome.

I certainly want you to know [LIT] that. But I have not been able to come to you because I have been hindered {things have always prevented me} until the present time.

Specifically, God first has saved the Jews who believe the good message, and then he has saved non-Jews."]},{"type":"verse","number":17,"content":["By means of this good message God reveals how he erases the record of people’s sins (OR, declares people no longer guilty for having sinned); and his doing this is entirely because [IDM] they trust in Christ. This is confirmed by what a prophet long ago wrote that God said, “Those ◄whose record of sin I have erased/whom I have declared no longer guilty for sin► because they trust in me will live forever.”"]},{"type":"heading","content":["God is making it clear to all non-Jewish people who are godless and wicked that he is angry with them."]},{"type":"verse","number":18,"content":["From where God rules in heaven he is making it clear to all non-Jewish people who show no respect for God and who do wicked things, that he is angry with them and that they deserve to be punished {that he would punish them} [MTY].

But ever since he created the world, by means of what he created he has clearly revealed what he is like. He has made clear to everyone that he has always been able to do very powerful things. Therefore, we should recognize that God is powerful, completely different from all that he created.

Instead, they made and worshipped idols that resembled people who will some day die, and then they made other idols that resembled birds and four-footed animals, and finally they made idols that resembled reptiles."]},{"type":"heading","content":["So God let the non-Jewish people feel compelled to do disgraceful things, which resulted in their dishonoring their bodies sexually. He did this because they worshipped idols and things that were created instead of worshipping God. As a result of both men and women having unnatural sexual relations, they have been punished as they deserve."]},{"type":"verse","number":24,"content":["So God allowed the non-Jews do immoral sexual things that they [SYN] strongly desired, things that their desires were compelling them to do. As a result, they began to dishonor each other’s bodies by their sexual actions."]},{"type":"verse","number":25,"content":["Also, they chose to worship false gods instead ◄of admitting/of choosing to believe► what is true about God. They worshipped and served things that God created instead of worshipping and serving God himself, the one who created everything.

Amen!/May it be so!"]},{"type":"verse","number":26,"content":["So, God allowed the non-Jews to do shameful sexual things that they strongly desired. As a result, many women did not have natural sexual relations with their husbands [EUP]. Instead, they were doing sexual actions with other women [EUP]."]},{"type":"verse","number":27,"content":["Similarly, many men stopped having/did not have natural sexual relations with women [EUP]. Instead, they strongly desired to have sexual relations with other men. They committed homosexual acts with other men, acts that were shameful. As a result, God has punished them by sicknesses in their bodies, which is what they deserve because they thought wrongly that God would not punish them for doing that."]},{"type":"heading","content":["The result of God’s letting people become obsessed by their own depraved thoughts was that they themselves began to do all manner of evil things that God says are improper. They even approve of others doing such things."]},{"type":"verse","number":28,"content":["Furthermore, because they decided that it was not worthwhile to know God, he allowed their own worthless thoughts to completely control them. As a result, they began doing evil things that God says that people should not do."]},{"type":"verse","number":29,"content":["They strongly desire to do all kinds of unrighteous things.

Many treat others contemptuously. Many boast about themselves to others. Many invent new ways to do evil things. Many non-Jewish children disobey their parents."]},{"type":"verse","number":31,"content":["Many non-Jews act in other morally foolish ways. Many do not do what they promised others that they would do. Many do not even love their own family members. And many do not act mercifully toward other people."]},{"type":"verse","number":32,"content":["Although they know that God has declared that those who do such things deserve to be killed, they not only habitually do these kinds of evil things, but they also approve of others who habitually do them."]}],"footnotes":[]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_t4t/ROM/1.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_t4t/ROM/2.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_t4t/ACT/28.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":32}
