My fellow believers, continue to rejoice because you belong to the Lord. Though I will now write to you about those same matters that I mentioned to you before, this is not tiresome for me, and it will protect you from those who would harm you spiritually."]},{"type":"heading","content":["Beware of those unholy people who will harm you spiritually by insisting that you must be circumcised in order to become God’s people."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["Beware of those people who are dangerous [MET] like wild dogs. They are dangerous evildoers [DOU]. Beware of them since they are like people who cut other people’s bodies [MET]. They will harm you spiritually by insisting that you must let someone circumcise you in order for you to become God’s people [MTY, MET]."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["Those people think that they are God’s people because someone has circumcised them. But we, not they, are truly God’s people [MET], whether or not someone has circumcised us. God’s Spirit enables us to [MTY] worship God; we praise Christ Jesus because he has enabled us to become the people of God. We do not believe that God will consider/make us his people as a result of what someone has done to our bodies [MTY, SYN]."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["We do not trust in those rituals to make us acceptable to God, although I could very well do that if it would be useful for me. Since I was circumcised properly and have a purely Hebrew ancestry, and since I kept the Jewish laws blamelessly, I could rely upon what I have done and who I am better than anyone else could, if it were beneficial for my salvation. Philippians 3:4b-6 In fact, if I could benefit from it for my salvation, I could rely upon what I have done and who I am [MTY, SYN] more than anyone else could! I will tell you why."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["I was circumcised {Someone circumcised me} when I was one week old. I am from the people of Israel. I am from the tribe of Benjamin.

Indeed, as far as my obeying those laws is concerned, no one could have accused me by saying that I had disobeyed any of those laws."]},{"type":"heading","content":["I now consider all these advantages that I once supposed would help me to be worthless, and I consider everything else as well to be worthless, because I want to know Christ, to be united with him, and to be made righteous through trusting in Christ alone."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["Nevertheless, all such things as those, which I used to consider to be useful to me, those very things I now consider worthless, because I want to know Christ (OR, in order that I may know Christ)."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["More than that, I consider all things to be worthless, compared to how great it is to know Christ Jesus my Lord.

I consider them as useless as [MET] rubbish, in order that I may have a close relationship with Christ [MET],"]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["and in order that I may completely belong to him. It was not as a result of my obeying the laws he gave Moses that God erased the record of my sins. Instead, it is because I have trusted in Christ that God has declared that I am no longer guilty for my sins, and he enables me to act righteously. It is God himself who has erased the record of my sins, and he enables me to act righteously, only because I have trusted in Christ."]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["I want to know Christ better and better. Particularly, I want to continually experience his working powerfully in my life, just like God worked powerfully when he caused Christ to become alive after he died. I also want to be continually willing to suffer in order that I may obey God, just like Christ suffered in order that he might obey God.

But I earnestly try to become more and more like Christ, because he chose me in order that I might become like him."]},{"type":"verse","number":13,"content":["My fellow believers, I certainly do not consider that I have already become completely like Christ. But I am like a runner. A runner does not look backward [MET]. Instead, he leans/stretches forward as he runs straight toward the goal in order that he might win the race and get the prize. Similarly, I do not think about what I have already done."]},{"type":"verse","number":14,"content":["Instead, I concentrate only on continuing to become more and more like Christ right up to the end of my life [MET]. As a result, because of my relationship with Christ Jesus, God will call/summon me to receive a reward from him in heaven."]},{"type":"verse","number":15,"content":["So, all of us who are spiritually mature should think this same way.
