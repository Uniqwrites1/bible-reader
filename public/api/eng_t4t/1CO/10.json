They were all under the cloud by which God miraculously led them and protected them when they left Egypt with Moses. All those ancestors crossed the Red Sea after God miraculously made the water separate so that they could walk through it."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["God caused all of them to begin to live under the authority of [MTY] Moses when they walked under that cloud and walked through the Red Sea."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["All those ancestors of ours ate the same food that God miraculously provided."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["They all drank water that God miraculously provided. That is, they all drank water that God miraculously made come out of the rock. That rock was a symbol of [MET] Christ, who went with them. So we conclude that God helped all of those people in many ways."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["However, we also conclude that God was angry [LIT] with most of those people because they sinned against him. He caused almost all of them to die, and as a result their bodies were scattered in the desert."]},{"type":"heading","content":["What happened to our Jewish ancestors was a warning of what will happen to us if we give in to temptation."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["Those things that happened long ago became examples to teach us the following things: We should not desire to do evil things as those people desired to do."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["We should not worship idols as many of those people did.

Then they got up to dance immorally.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["We should not have sexual relations with someone to whom we are not married, as many of them did. As a result, God punished them by causing 23,000 people to die in only one day."]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["We should not try to see how much we can sin without the Lord punishing us. Some of them did that, and as a result they died because poisonous snakes bit them."]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["We should not complain about what God does. Some of them did that, and as a result an angel destroyed them. So God will certainly punish us if we sin like they did."]},{"type":"verse","number":11,"content":["All those things that happened to our ancestors long ago are examples for us. Moses wrote those things to warn us who are living at this time which is near the end. We are the people for whom God has done the things that he decided to do in the previous periods of time."]},{"type":"verse","number":12,"content":["So I say this to all those who confidently think that they will always steadfastly continue to believe what God said and will never disobey what he commanded: Be careful that you (sg) do not sin when you are tempted."]},{"type":"verse","number":13,"content":["Remember that your desires to sin are the same desires that other people have. But when you are tempted to sin, you can trust God to help you. He will not permit you to be tempted {anything to tempt you} more than you are able to resist.
