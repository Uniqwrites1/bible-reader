Instead, I had to teach you as I would teach people whom their self-directed nature controls. I taught very simple concepts to you who had recently believed in Christ, as a parent would speak very simple words to a baby."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["I did not teach you things that were difficult for you to understand, just like a woman does not give her baby solid food that the baby cannot chew and digest. And just like a woman ◄gives her baby milk/breast-feeds her baby►, I taught you simple spiritual concepts, because at that time you were not able to understand difficult things. And you are still not able to understand difficult concepts,"]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["because you are still controlled by your self-directed nature. Some of you are jealous and quarreling. ◄That shows that your self-directed nature is controlling you!/Does not that prove your self-directed nature is controlling you?► [RHQ] It shows that you are acting like unbelievers act."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["By some of you saying, “I am loyal to Paul,” and others saying, “I am loyal to Apollos,” ◄you show that you are acting like unbelievers./does not it show that you are acting like unbelievers?► [RHQ]"]},{"type":"heading","content":["I preached the gospel to you first, and Apollos followed, but we are both serving God equally."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["So what you really ought to think about Apollos and me [RHQ] is that we(dl) are merely men who serve God. As a result of our telling you the message about Christ, you trusted in him.

I was like [MET] someone who plants seeds. Later, Apollos taught you more of God’s message. That was like [MET] someone who waters plants after they start to grow. But it is God who enables people to grow spiritually, just like he is the one who causes plants to grow."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["So the person who first preaches God’s message to people is not important, and the person who later teaches people more of God’s message is not important, just like [MET] it is not the person who plants the seeds or the person who waters the plants who is important.

Just like a field belongs to its owner, not to those who work in it, you belong to God, not to us who work for him. Each one who teaches believers must examine what he is teaching them because God will reward him only if his teaching is valuable and long-lasting. 1 Corinthians 3:9b-15 Also, a house belongs to its owner. It does not belong to the man who built it. Similarly, God is the one to whom you belong."]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["Just like a skilled person puts a foundation in the ground before he builds a house, as a result of God kindly helping me [MET], I was the first one who declared the message about Christ to you. And, just like others build a house on its foundation, there were others who later taught you more about Christ. But just like each person who builds a house must be careful about what materials he uses to build it [MET], each person who teaches God’s truth must be careful about what he teaches."]},{"type":"verse","number":11,"content":["Just like people can put in only one foundation for a house [MET], there is only one message that we can give to people. That message is about Jesus Christ."]},{"type":"verse","number":12,"content":["Furthermore, people can build a house on its foundation with materials that are valuable and do not burn easily, such as gold, silver, and expensive jewels. Or they could build a house with materials that are not valuable and that burn easily, such as wood, hay, and straw."]},{"type":"verse","number":13,"content":["Later it will become clear/evident what kind of material they used to build the house. Similarly, when people teach others God’s truth, it will later become clear what kind of things they taught.

Similarly [MET], when God judges us, it will be clear whether we taught others things that were long-lasting and valuable or not. If the materials that are used to build a house are materials that do not burn, the builder will receive a reward [MET]. Similarly, if we have taught others things that are valuable and long-lasting, God will give us a reward."]},{"type":"verse","number":15,"content":["If the things that we have taught are not valuable and long-lasting [MET], we will not get a reward.
