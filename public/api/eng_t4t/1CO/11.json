You have done just like I told you to do."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["Now, I want you to know that the one who has authority over [MTY] every man is Christ, and the ones who have authority over women are men (OR, their husbands), and the one who has authority over Christ is God."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["So if any man wears a covering over his head when he prays or speaks a message God gave him, he disgraces himself [SYN]."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["Also, if any woman does not wear a covering over her head when she prays or speaks a message that God gave her, she disgraces herself (OR, she dishonors her husband). That would be acting like [SIM] women who are ashamed because their heads have been shaved."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["So, if women do not wear coverings over their heads when they pray or speak messages that God gave them, they should let someone shave their heads so that they will be ashamed. But since women are ashamed if someone cuts their hair short or shaves off their hair, they should wear coverings over their heads when they pray or speak messages that God gave them."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["Men should not wear coverings over their heads when they pray or speak messages that God gave them, because they represent what God is like [MET] and they show how great God is. But women show how great men (OR, their husbands) are."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["Remember that God intends that men have authority over women. We know that because God did not make the first man, Adam, from the first woman, Eve. Instead, he made that woman from a bone that he took from the man."]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["Also, God did not create the first man to help the woman. Instead, he created the woman to help the man."]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["For that reason, women should wear something to cover their heads as a symbol of their being under their husbands’ [MTY] authority. They should also cover their heads so that the angels will see that and rejoice."]},{"type":"verse","number":11,"content":["However, remember that even though God created the first woman from the first man, all other men have been born from women. So men cannot be independent of women, nor can women be independent of men. But all things, including men and women, come from God."]},{"type":"verse","number":13,"content":["Consider this for yourselves: Is it proper for [RHQ] women to pray to God while they do not have coverings over their heads?"]},{"type":"verse","number":14,"content":["◄Everyone senses that it is disgraceful for men to have long hair./Doesn’t everyone sense that it is disgraceful for men to have long hair?► [RHQ]"]},{"type":"verse","number":15,"content":["But it is very delightful if women have long hair, because God gave them long hair to be like a beautiful covering for their heads."]},{"type":"verse","number":16,"content":["But whoever wants to argue with me about my saying that women should have a covering over their heads when they pray or speak a message from God should consider the fact that we apostles do not permit any other custom, and the other congregations of God do not have any other custom."]},{"type":"heading","content":["When you gather to eat the Lord’s Supper, you act selfishly.
