But I did not decide by myself to do that. I am simply doing the work that God entrusted to me."]},{"type":"verse","number":18,"content":["So perhaps you wonder what my reward is. [RHQ] I will tell you. When I proclaim the good message about Christ, I do not ask people for financial help. It makes me very happy not to ask for help, and being happy is the reward I get.
