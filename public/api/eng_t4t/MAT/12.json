And God did not consider that what they did was wrong"]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["Also, think about the laws that Moses wrote [RHQ].

So, it is more important for you to obey my teachings than to obey your traditions about our rest day."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["You should think about these words of God in the Scriptures: ‘I want you to act mercifully toward people, and not just offer sacrifices.’ If you understood what that means, you would not condemn my disciples, who have done no wrong."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["And I want you to know that I, the one who came from heaven, have the authority to determine what is right for my disciples to do on the days of rest.”"]},{"type":"heading","content":["Jesus healed a man on the Sabbath.
