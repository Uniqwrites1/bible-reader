But do not do what they do, because they themselves do not do what they tell you that you must do."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["They require you to obey many rules that are difficult to obey. But they themselves do not help anyone obey those rules. It is as if they are tying up loads that are hard to carry and putting them on your shoulders [MET] for you to carry. But they themselves do not desire to help anyone obey those laws.

Whatever they do, they do it to be seen by other people {so that other people will see them doing that}. For example, they make extra wide the tiny boxes containing portions of Scripture that they wear on their arms. They enlarge the tassels on their robes, to make others think that they are pious."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["They want people to honor them. For example, at dinner parties they sit in the seats where the most important people sit. In the places of worship they want to sit in the seats where the most honored people sit."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["Also, they want people to greet them respectfully in the marketplaces and to honor them by calling them ‘Teacher’."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["But you who are my disciples should not allow people to address you honorably as ‘Rabbi’, which means ‘teacher’. I am the only one who is really your teacher, which means that you are all equal, like brothers and sisters, and none of you should act superior to another, as the Pharisees do."]},{"type":"verse","number":9,"content":["Do not honor anyone on earth by addressing him as ‘Father’, because God, your Father in heaven, is the only spiritual father of all of you."]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["Do not allow people to call you ‘Instructors’, because I, the Messiah, am the one instructor who teaches all of you."]},{"type":"verse","number":11,"content":["In contrast, everyone among you who wants God to consider them to be important must serve others as servants do."]},{"type":"verse","number":12,"content":["God will humble those who exalt themselves.

There will be terrible punishment for you, because by teaching what is false, you prevent people [MTY/HYP] who are thinking about letting God rule their lives from doing that [MET]. What you are doing is like closing a gate [MET] so that people who are wanting to enter a city cannot go in. As for you, you do not let God rule your lives. Neither do you allow other people to let God rule their lives.

But if they ask the gold that is in the Temple to affirm what they have promised, they must do what they promised.’"]},{"type":"verse","number":17,"content":["You are fools, and you are like people who are blind [MET]! The gold that is in the Temple is important, but the Temple is even more important [RHQ], because it is the Temple that the gold is in that sets the gold apart for a special use for God."]},{"type":"verse","number":18,"content":["Also you say, ‘In the case of those who promise to do something and then ask the altar to affirm what they have promised, it means nothing if they do not do what they have promised.

You are hypocrites because, even though you give to God a tenth of the herbs you produce, such as mint, dill, and cummin, you do not obey God’s laws that are more important. For example, you do not act justly toward others, you do not act mercifully toward people, and you are not trustworthy. It is good to give a tenth of your herbs to God, but you should also obey these other more important laws."]},{"type":"verse","number":24,"content":["You leaders are like blind people who are trying to lead others. According to your laws you say that touching gnats and camels makes you unacceptable to God. What you are doing is like straining a gnat out of a jar of water so that you do not swallow it and thereby become unacceptable to God, and at the same time swallowing a camel with the water [MET]!”"]},{"type":"heading","content":["Jesus also rebuked the religious leaders about being greedy and selfish."]},{"type":"verse","number":25,"content":["“You men who teach people the Jewish laws and you Pharisees, your punishment will be terrible!
