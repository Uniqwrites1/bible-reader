One of the boats belonged to Simon."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["Jesus got in that boat and asked Simon to push the boat a little bit away from the shore so that he could speak to the crowd more easily. Jesus sat in the boat and taught the people who were on the shore."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["After he finished speaking to them, he said to Simon, “Push the boat out to where the water is deep. Then let your nets down into the water to catch some fish!”"]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["Simon replied, “Master, we (exc) worked hard all night but we did not catch any fish.

So they came and filled both the boats with fish from the net. The result was that the boats were so full that they began to sink."]},{"type":"verse","number":8,"content":["Simon and all the men who were with him were amazed at how many fish they had taken. James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, who were Simon’s partners, were among those who were amazed. When Simon, whose other name was Peter, saw the fish, feeling ashamed to be in the presence of someone who obviously had God’s power, he prostrated himself before Jesus and said, “Lord, you should go away from me, because I am a sinful man!”"]},{"type":"verse","number":10,"content":["But Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid!

First, go to a priest in Jerusalem and show yourself to him so that he can examine you and verify that you no longer have leprosy. After the priest tells the local people, they will know that you have been healed, and you will be able to associate with them again. Also take to the priest the offering that Moses commanded that people who have been healed from leprosy should offer.”"]},{"type":"verse","number":15,"content":["But many people heard the man’s report of what Jesus had done.

He said, “People never tear a piece of cloth from a new garment and attach it to an old garment to mend it. If they did that, not only would they be ruining the new garment by tearing it, but the new piece of cloth would not match the old garment."]},{"type":"verse","number":37,"content":["Neither does anyone put freshly-squeezed grape juice into old skin bags to store it.
