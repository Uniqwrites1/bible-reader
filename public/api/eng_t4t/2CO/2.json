I wrote it the way I did so that you would know what you should do. Then when I come to visit you, you will not make me unhappy when you should be causing me to rejoice. I was quite sure that all of you would do what I told you to do in that letter, and because of that I would be happy and you would be happy, too."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["I wrote to you the way I did because I felt very troubled and distressed about you. I was even crying very much as I wrote. My purpose in writing was not in order to make you feel bad, but, instead, in order that you might know how deeply/much I love you."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["Now I want to write about the man who caused all this anguish. What he did was very wrong, but I know that it has caused you much more sorrow than it has caused me, because what he did has affected all of you to some extent. I say, “to some extent,” because I do not want to say that he has done more harm than he really has done."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["Since he has now stopped sinning in that way, the punishment that nearly all of you decided was right for him has continued long enough."]},{"type":"verse","number":7,"content":["So now, instead of punishing him any longer, you need to forgive him and deal kindly with him.

Anything he needed me to forgive him for, I have forgiven, and Christ knows that I have forgiven him sincerely. I have done that mainly to help you so that you and I will again have fellowship with each other, and that you will accept him into your group again."]},{"type":"verse","number":11,"content":["I want you to forgive him so that Satan will not be able to take advantage of the problems among us and make the situation worse. We know very well [LIT] that Satan is always planning to cause problems among us."]},{"type":"heading","content":["I did not find Titus in Troas, so I went on to Macedonia province.

As a great leader of fighting men causes all his prisoners to take part in his victory parade [MET], God leads us who are his workers to always be victorious over Satan because of our(exc) close relationship with Christ. God causes people to come to know Jesus Christ as a result of our (exc) teaching his message. That message is like [MET] the smell of perfume."]},{"type":"verse","number":15,"content":["When we(exc) tell God’s message about Christ, it spreads out among people like the smell of perfume.

But, to those on the way to heaven, the message that we teach is like a pure fragrant smell, because we tell them that they will live forever with God. As we think about that, we think ◄no one is able to do such important work for God!/how can anyone be able to do such important work for God?► [RHQ]"]},{"type":"verse","number":17,"content":["But perhaps God considers us(exc) able, because we do not work/act like so many others whom you know.
