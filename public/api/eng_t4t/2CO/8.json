Although they are very poor, they gave very generously to help other believers."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["I know that this is true, because I have seen for myself that they not only gave money [EUP] that they were able to give, they gave so much money that they did not even keep enough to buy what they needed for themselves.
