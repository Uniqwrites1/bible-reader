It is [RHQ] because each of you wants to do evil things [PRS]. You keep on wanting to do things that are not what God wants you to do."]},{"type":"verse","number":2,"content":["There are things that you very much desire to have, but you do not get those things, so you want to kill [HYP] those who hinder you from getting them. You desire what other people have, but you are unable to get what you desire, so you quarrel and fight with one another [HYP]. You do not have what you desire because you do not ask God for it."]},{"type":"verse","number":3,"content":["And even when you do ask him, he does not give you what you ask for because you are asking for the wrong reason. You are asking for things in order that you may use them just to ◄enjoy yourselves/make yourselves happy►."]},{"type":"heading","content":["You are unfaithful to God and are behaving as evil people do, so you have become God’s enemies, but he wants to help you. He opposes the proud, but he helps those who are humble."]},{"type":"verse","number":4,"content":["Like a woman who is unfaithful to her husband, you are being unfaithful to God and not obeying him any more [MET]. Those who are behaving as evil people do [MTY] (OR, Those who love the evil pleasures of this world) are hostile toward God. Perhaps you do not realize that [RHQ]. So those who decide to act as evil people do [MTY] become enemies of God."]},{"type":"verse","number":5,"content":["◄Surely you remember that God told us in the Scriptures that he eagerly desires that his Spirit, who lives in us, will help us to love God only!/Do you think that it is for no reason that God told us in the Scriptures that he strongly desires that his Spirit, who lives in us, will help us to love God only?► [RHQ] God has a reason for desiring that."]},{"type":"verse","number":6,"content":["It is because he is kind to us and he wants very much to help us.

Only God has the right to condemn people."]},{"type":"verse","number":11,"content":["My fellow believers, stop saying evil things about one another, because those who say something evil about a fellow believer and are therefore condemning one who is like a brother to them are really speaking against the law that God gave us to obey. In this law, God commanded [MTY] us to love others, and those who say evil things about fellow believers, it is as though they are saying that we do not have to do what God commanded. If you (sg) say that you do not have to do what God commanded, you (sg) are not obeying God’s law. Instead, you (sg) are claiming that you have the authority to condemn others."]},{"type":"verse","number":12,"content":["But in fact, there is only one who has the authority to tell people what is right to do and to condemn them, and that is God. He alone is able to save people or to destroy people. So, ◄you (sg) certainly have no right to decide how God should punish other people./who are you to decide how God should punish other people?► [RHQ]"]},{"type":"heading","content":["You should not boast about what you will do in the future, because life is transitory.
