If salvation is by grace, where does ‘being worthy’ come in? Well, again we are faced with the paradox of the coexistence of God's sovereignty and human responsibility. “God's judgment” = sovereignty; suffering to be “considered worthy” = responsibility. The gift of life in Christ is indeed free; we do not deserve it and cannot buy it or earn it.

So what about the millions of individuals born into cultures where no representative of the Creator has ever gone? Romans 1:18-25 makes clear that all have the light of creation. Since all human knowledge is based on the principle of cause and effect, any rational creature must conclude that there has to be a sufficient Cause for the marvelous creation he sees all around. Each one is also born with a conscience. No doubt anyone who responds correctly to the light of creation will receive more light. That said, however, one gains the impression that there will be degrees of punishment, according to the amount of light rejected.
