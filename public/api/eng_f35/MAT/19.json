The Lord corrects their distortion.","reference":{"chapter":19,"verse":7}},{"noteId":2153,"caller":"+","text":"“Fornication” is distinct from “adultery” and does not include it. Here, it is presumably a reference to premarital sex, where a groom discovers that his bride is no longer a virgin (like the situation that Joseph faced in Matthew 1:18-19). Perhaps 0.5% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit the last clause of verse 9 (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.).","reference":{"chapter":19,"verse":9}},{"noteId":2154,"caller":"+","text":"Why the strong reaction from the disciples? Obviously Jesus did not give the expected answer, namely that infidelity justifies divorce.","reference":{"chapter":19,"verse":10}},{"noteId":2155,"caller":"+","text":"The demonstrative pronoun ‘this’ is probably cataphoric, referring forward to the content of verse 12.","reference":{"chapter":19,"verse":11}},{"noteId":2156,"caller":"+","text":"What in the world do ‘eunuchs’ have to do with divorce and remarriage? Well, do eunuchs have sexual relations? A eunuch castrated by others was a victim of the actions of others.

He is challenging the man's opinion about Himself. The man was not recognizing Jesus to be God—if he had, Jesus would not have objected. Perhaps 1% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit “Good” before “teacher” in verse 16 and have Jesus saying, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is One who is good” here in verse 17 (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.). The minority reading makes Matthew contradict Mark 10:18 and Luke 18:9; it probably originated in Egypt, that was dominated by Gnosticism.","reference":{"chapter":19,"verse":17}},{"noteId":2158,"caller":"+","text":"Did he think that some were not necessary?","reference":{"chapter":19,"verse":18}},{"noteId":2159,"caller":"+","text":"“Since my youth” is omitted by 1% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.).","reference":{"chapter":19,"verse":20}},{"noteId":2160,"caller":"+","text":"Jesus emphasized the commandment about loving one's neighbor because that was precisely the one that the young man was not keeping.

However, since in verse 26 Jesus says it is “impossible” we may stay with the literal meaning. Jesus had already said that one cannot serve God and money, so someone who “trusts in riches” (Mark 10:24, as in 99.5% of the Greek manuscripts) simply cannot be saved (unless he abandons that trust).","reference":{"chapter":19,"verse":24}},{"noteId":2162,"caller":"+","text":"I take it that Jesus is referring to His millennial reign, the Messianic Kingdom, when the earth will be ‘regenerated’, being restored to conditions reminiscent of Eden.

Actually, the ‘hundredfold’ should presumably not be taken in a strictly literal sense. I take it that the Lord is saying that we will be abundantly recompensed, if not down here, certainly in heaven. In my own experience, in the absence of my real mother, whenever I needed one God provided one. If you only have one brother, that is all you can leave, obviously, so the plural nouns are also contingent on the facts in the case. ‘Eternal’ life is a quality of life, and it begins down here.","reference":{"chapter":19,"verse":29}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_f35/MAT/19.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/MAT/20.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/MAT/18.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":30}
