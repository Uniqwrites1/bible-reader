Hebrew poetry, and prose, makes heavy use of parallel or synonymous statements. From the context in Isaiah it seems clear that “in the wilderness” goes with the verb ‘make straight’, not ‘call out’. But why a straight road in the wilderness? Any road facilitates the movement of people and goods, but a straight road through accidented terrain is a major asset. (Actually, Isaiah 40:3-4 describes the construction of a modern superhighway.) John was the voice, but it was the people who had to make the road. So how about us? Are we supposed to be making such a road, and if so, how? At the very least we should be proclaiming biblical values to the world by every available means.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":3}},{"noteId":1897,"caller":"+","text":"They had notions of spiritual privilege based on birth, but as someone has said, God has no grandchildren.

The ‘and fire’ we are used to is read by only 20% of the Greek manuscripts. The 80% includes the best line of transmission. However, Luke 3:16 has the ‘and fire’.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":11}},{"noteId":1900,"caller":"+","text":"Can you have wheat without chaff? Isn't the chaff part of the wheat plant? What might the implications of this analogy be for the Church? What percentage of the plant is edible wheat? Wherever Christianity is the state or majority religion, or part of the prevailing culture, a large majority of the ‘Christians’ will be chaff. Where Christians are persecuted a high percentage will be wheat. Since Judaism was part of the prevailing culture, presumably most of John's hearers were chaff. The ‘unquenchable’ fire is presumably a reference to the Lake.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":12}},{"noteId":1901,"caller":"+","text":"John knew that Jesus was the Messiah.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":14}},{"noteId":1902,"caller":"+","text":"Our Lord's statement here seems difficult to us. Since Mark 1:4 and Luke 3:3 state that it was “a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins” but Jesus had no sins to repent of, in what sense was He “fulfilling all righteousness”?
