That Jesus was born at night is clear from Luke 2:8-12. The angels appeared at night (verse 8) and said “this day” (verse 11)—the shepherds were Jews, and the Jewish day began at 6:00 p.m. Since the shepherds broadcasted the message delivered by the angel, any people in the town who loved God would want to help Joseph.

All the events recorded in verses 1-8 presumably happened the same day. It is only some ten miles from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, but it may have been already dark when they started out.

If the magi took off immediately, as I suppose, then the angel roused Joseph as soon as they were out the door.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":11}},{"noteId":1888,"caller":"+","text":"Because the gifts were three, some have assumed that the magi were three, but nowhere does the Text specify the number.

The name of the town in Hebrew is based on the consonants נצר (resh, tsadde, nun), but since Hebrew is read from right to left, for us the order is reversed = n, ts, r. This word root means ‘branch’. Greek has the equivalent for ‘ps’ and ‘ks’, but not for ‘ts’, so the transliteration used a ζ (zeta) ‘dz’, which is the voiced counterpart of ‘ts’. But when the Greek was transliterated into English it came out as ‘z’! But Hebrew has a ‘z’, ז (zayin), so in transliterating back into Hebrew people assumed the consonants נזר, replacing the correct tsadde with zayin. This technical information is necessary as background for the next footnote.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":23}},{"noteId":1895,"caller":"+","text":"Neither ‘Nazareth’ nor ‘Nazarene’, spelled with a zayin, is to be found in the Old Testament, but there is a prophetic reference to Messiah as the Branch, netser—Isaiah 11:1—and several to the related word, tsemach—Isaiah 4:2; Jeremiah 23:5; 33:15; Zechariah 3:8; 6:12. So Matthew is quite right—the prophets (plural, being at least three) referred to Christ as the Branch. Since Jesus was a man, He would be the ‘Branch-man’, from ‘Branch-town’. Which brings us to the word ‘Natsorean’. The familiar ‘Nazarene’ (Ναζαρηνος) [Natsarene] occurs in Mark 1:24; 14:67; 16:6 and Luke 4:34, but here in Matthew 2:23 and in fourteen other places, including Acts 22:8 where the glorified Jesus calls Himself that, the word is ‘Natsorean’ (Ναζωραιος), which is quite different. (Actually, in Acts 22:8 Jesus introduced Himself to Saul as ‘the Natsorean’, which Saul would understand as a reference to the Messiah.) To my surprise, Pilate put “the Natsorean” in the accusation above the cross—John 19:19. I have been given to understand that the Nazareth of Jesus' day had been founded some 100 years before by a Branch family who called it Branch town; they were very much aware of the prophecies about the Branch and fully expected the Messiah to be born from among them—they called themselves Branch-people (Natsoreans). Of course everyone else thought it was a big joke and tended to look down on them. “Can anything good…?”","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":23}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_f35/MAT/2.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/MAT/3.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/MAT/1.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":23}
