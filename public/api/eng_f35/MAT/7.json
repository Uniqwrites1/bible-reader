But just who are ‘the dogs’ and ‘the pigs’? A pig will sniff the pearl and perhaps think it a stone—it not being edible the pig will ignore it and it will get trampled into the mud. So a ‘pig’ is someone who is incapable of recognizing or appreciating the ‘pearl’—the reaction will be one of total indifference. So do not waste your time. In contrast a ‘dog’ reacts in an aggressively hostile manner against what is ‘holy’. So a ‘dog’ is presumably someone who is committed to evil and will therefore attack what is holy. In general our media today are controlled by ‘dogs’. So do not innocently offer what is holy to a ‘dog’—you will get chewed up! We need to try to convert the ‘dogs’, but you need to understand what you are about. Anyone who has sold out to Satan will almost certainly have a resident demon, and we have the authority to bind such.","reference":{"chapter":7,"verse":6}},{"noteId":1974,"caller":"+","text":"I take it that we are authorized to ask!","reference":{"chapter":7,"verse":11}},{"noteId":1975,"caller":"+","text":"This is the so-called ‘golden rule’—if everyone did this the world would be a better place.","reference":{"chapter":7,"verse":12}},{"noteId":1976,"caller":"+","text":"Observe that the Lord Jesus Christ affirms that “few” find the way of life.
