I take ‘suffer in flesh’ to be a euphemism for death, and when one dies he stops sinning [I suppose]. All during His earthly life Jesus knew He was going to die on account of sins and was totally committed to doing the Father's will. With the same mentality we too will be committed to doing God's will, and so will avoid sin. “Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin but alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord” (Romans 6:11). Verse two here agrees that this is not automatic—we must determine not to indulge the flesh.","reference":{"chapter":4,"verse":1}},{"noteId":166,"caller":"+","text":"The Greek manuscripts are about evenly divided between “you” and ‘us’, but the best line of transmission has “you”, which jives with verse 4.","reference":{"chapter":4,"verse":3}},{"noteId":167,"caller":"+","text":"All the nouns in this list are actually plural, emphasizing that their life was characterized by these things.

Verse 5 ends with “judge living and dead”, but anyone who is dead was once alive, obviously, and the judgment will be based on what they did while alive, which is why everyone needs to be evangelized while in this life (including the people who are making fun of us). There is no definite article with “dead”, either in verse 5 or 6, so Peter is referring to the ones who were evangelized in this life—he is not saying that everyone has been or will be evangelized. Everyone will be judged, but to “live according to God in spirit” one must respond adequately to the Gospel.","reference":{"chapter":4,"verse":6}},{"noteId":170,"caller":"+","text":"Haven't you heard a lot of ‘praying’ that would not qualify?","reference":{"chapter":4,"verse":7}},{"noteId":171,"caller":"+","text":"Love overlooks sins, does not make a big deal out of them, in interpersonal relationships.
