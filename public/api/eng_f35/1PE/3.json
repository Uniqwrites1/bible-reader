But then, when did the Sovereign Lord ever worry about being ‘politically correct’, especially in a culture heavily influenced by Satan? And when did the Sovereign's true servants ever worry about being ‘politically correct’ in such a culture? Remember James 4:4—“Adulterers and adulteresses! [so 98% of the Greek manuscripts]. Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? So whoever may want to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.” 1 John 2:15-17 is to the same effect. To love the things of the world (especially its values) is to adulterate against God: “the love of the Father is not in him”. As Joshua said so long ago, “Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve” (Joshua 24:15). In Genesis 3:16 the Creator said to the woman, “your desire shall be for your husband”—a woman's emotional health and sense of security are heavily influenced by her husband's attitudes, more so than vice versa.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":7}},{"noteId":148,"caller":"+","text":"“The grace of life”—I love it.

Peter gives a little more detail in his second letter, 2:4-6. “For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to Tartarus and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly; and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction…” So the spirits in question are angels. Jude 6-7 refers to those same angels: “and the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day; as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these [angels], having given themselves over to fornication and gone after a different kind of flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.” Recall that the men of Sodom wanted to rape the angels who were in Lot's house; whatever kind of flesh angels have when they materialize, it is not human flesh, it is precisely a different kind of flesh. So the angels in question are the ones who cohabited with women, producing the mongrel race of nephilim (Genesis 6:2-4). Their crime was so terrible that God incarcerated them even before Jehovah the Son became flesh and defeated Satan—they were put in cold (or hot) storage until human history played itself out. So the “proclamation” that Jesus went to make to those spirits was that he had won and that their condemnation was now irreversible.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":19}},{"noteId":161,"caller":"+","text":"It probably took Noah at least 100 years.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":20}},{"noteId":162,"caller":"+","text":"Why “antitype” rather than ‘type’? I suppose because the roles are reversed: the ark was to save Noah from the water, the water was the problem; in baptism the water is part of the solution, it saves us from something else. From what, from sin and death? Probably not. I have been given to understand that for the early Church water baptism was meant to do the following: by invoking the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the convert was placing himself under Christ's protection and repudiating Satan and the world system (with its values) and the demons controlled by him. Recall that in the New Testament water baptism followed immediately upon conversion (no weeks or months of instruction). Peter discounts the physical effect of water—the point is to appeal to God in good conscience—and goes on to the victory of Christ over death and the whole angelic hierarchy. So obviously He is in a position to protect us from Satan and his angels.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":21}},{"noteId":163,"caller":"+","text":"I believe that this truth is directly relevant to Ephesians 2:6 (see the footnote there).
