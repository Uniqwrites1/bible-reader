Well, when we are suffering it is easy to question God's goodness, to think that we are being picked on, to feel sorry for ourselves, and so on—our faith starts to waver and Satan has all sorts of fun. ‘Devour’ means to gobble up (or gobble down); for a while I lived among a people in the Amazon jungle who used to practice cannibalism—I was assured that human flesh is sweet; now really, would any self-respecting ‘lion’ turn up his nose at such a treat?
