Comparing this passage with 1 Peter 3:19-20 and 2 Peter 2:4-5 and Genesis 6:2,4, it seems clear that certain angelic beings cohabited with women, producing a mongrel race, the nephilim. (The phrase ‘sons of God’ in Gen. 6:2,4 is a translation of the Hebrew phrase bene haelohim—the only other places this phrase occurs are in Job 1:6, 2:1 and 38:7, where the reference is clearly to angelic beings.) This was such a heinous crime that God incarcerated them millennia before the victory of Christ (that would justify the procedure; that is what He went to announce, as mentioned in 1 Peter 3:19). It was also a master stroke by Satan—since the male sperm transmits the human nature (Hebrews 7:9-10, Romans 5:12) and determines the blood of any child, if Satan had succeeded in contaminating the whole race, the Messiah could not be born and Genesis 3:15 could not be fulfilled.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":6}},{"noteId":1849,"caller":"+","text":"Recall that they wanted to rape the angels.

I always assumed that Moses went up Nebo alone (and since he did not return there would be no human witness), but the Text does not actually say so. Could it be possible that Joshua went along? Whether Joshua wrote it or God revealed it to someone, I take it that a written record was made and that Jude had access to a copy in his day. Being true information the Holy Spirit moved him to include it in his letter, which became the only inspired account of those details.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":9}},{"noteId":1855,"caller":"+","text":"For years I wondered why God included verse 9 in an inspired letter; what difference does it make what happened to Moses' corpse? I now understand that the corpse is a mere prop, the crucial thing being the relationship between the two boss angels—one the leader of the good ones and the other the leader of the bad ones. We understand from Isaiah 14:12-15 and Ezekiel 28:12-17 that Lucifer was created the number one angel, but when he rebelled against the Creator I assumed that he was demoted. In such an event Michael (I assume he was the original number two) the archangel (there is only one) would be superior to Satan and be able to order him away. But the Text says he did not ‘dare’ to be disrespectful, but had to content himself with appealing to God for help. Against my inclination, I feel obliged to conclude that Lucifer (now Satan) was not demoted—he continues higher in rank than Michael. The same would hold for the other angelic beings that followed Lucifer (Daniel 10:13, 20-21; Ephesians 6:12)—they maintain their original rank. However, what Michael did not dare do, we can. According to Ephesians 1:20-21 and 2:6, we who are in Christ are seated with Him far above all principality, power, etc. (the angelic hierarchy, good and bad). In Christ we are above Satan and may rebuke him directly (but do not forget James 4:7).","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":9}},{"noteId":1856,"caller":"+","text":"Those people were evidently rather crass materialists, controlled by their body's appetites.

It seems to me obvious that God must have given Adam instruction, after the Fall, about the necessity of animal sacrifice to cover their sins. To Cain, the rationalist, that didn't make sense, so he chose to worship God in his own way. When rejected he rebelled against God and even killed his brother; those who choose evil usually hate the good, because the good shows them up.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":11}},{"noteId":1858,"caller":"+","text":"Balaam prostituted his divine gift for material gain.

Those who promote humanistic, relativistic, materialistic ideas and values in the church are really ‘party-crashers’, agents of Satan's kingdom.

Servants of Satan who pretend to be Christians are too despicable for words.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":13}},{"noteId":1861,"caller":"+","text":"Since I believe that Jude was inspired by the Holy Spirit in writing this letter, then I understand that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, actually did write a prophecy and copies still existed in Jude's day. Note that this affirms the historicity/accuracy of the Genesis genealogy. If Enoch wrote, Adam also wrote, and their writings were preserved in Noah's Ark, becoming available for use by Moses and others. If the language spoken before the Flood was a type of Hebrew, as I assume, then Jude could easily read it. No copies of this prophecy in Hebrew are known today, though Jews are reported to have used one as late as the 13th century ad A few supposed copies in other languages have been found.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":15}},{"noteId":1862,"caller":"+","text":"There is no definite article with “spirit”, so Jude is probably not referring to the Holy Spirit here.

Don't forget our Lord's words in Matthew 24:37. If/since there are such humanoids among us today, our total ignorance on the subject is having very serious consequences in the culture at large.

Considering the violent description that Jude gives to the godless who have sneaked into the church, he presumably intends that such be identified and excluded without ceremony. So I take it that verses 22 and 23 refer to people in the church who have been influenced by those godless ones, in varying degrees. Some who are still wavering need to be treated with mercy, not harshly (v. 22). Others have pretty well sold out to the values of the godless and are almost to the point of no return—it will take energetic, if not desperate, action to snatch them from the jaws of hell (v. 23). You can't ‘snatch’ without direct contact, and there is the danger of contamination.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":22}},{"noteId":1866,"caller":"+","text":"1 John 2:15 says: “Do not love the world or the things in the world.

Jude is assuring his readers that it is worth the effort to snatch people from the very jaws of hell (v. 23), because God is able to secure them (one's natural tendency would be to doubt that). In commenting the parable of the lost sheep, the Lord Jesus affirmed that “there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.” It seems that God gets special pleasure out of cheating the Lake.
