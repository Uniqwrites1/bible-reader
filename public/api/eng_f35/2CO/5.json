Of course this only applies to those who belong to Sovereign Jesus.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":8}},{"noteId":429,"caller":"+","text":"If we are wise, like Paul, we will never forget the Accounting. He was ‘confident’ that upon leaving his physical body he would be at home with the Lord. To have the same confidence we also must consciously live so as to be well pleasing to Him. Notice that the emphasis is on what we do.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":10}},{"noteId":430,"caller":"+","text":"God's holiness is an aggressive quality that attacks anything evil that tries to approach. That holiness is truly intimidating, and we will all be judged by it. Jonathan Edwards preached on that basis, with extraordinary effect, but there are few in our day who follow his example. On a lower level, worldly people tend to feel uncomfortable in the presence of someone who is holy, sometimes to the point of reacting aggressively. As Satan increases his hold on the world, such aggressive reaction will become ever more common.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":11}},{"noteId":431,"caller":"+","text":"Paul will enlarge on this later on in the letter.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":12}},{"noteId":432,"caller":"+","text":"They all died in Him; just like all sinned in Adam.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":14}},{"noteId":433,"caller":"+","text":"I follow the best line of transmission, along with a minority of the manuscript total (35% here), in reading “all” instead of the familiar ‘them’.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":15}},{"noteId":434,"caller":"+","text":"The clearest statements giving why Christ died begin with Romans 14:9, “that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living”; followed by this verse, that we should no longer live for ourselves, but for Him. Philippians 2:8-11 refers to the final victory. Hebrews 2:14 refers to destroying Satan; saving us from hell is a by-product.

Jesus, God's Son, never sinned, did not ‘know’ sin, experientially, but He was “made to be sin” on our behalf. It is a grim picture, as though on the cross He was changed into a bundle of sin. And in exchange He gave us His righteousness. How can we ‘measure’ or understand such love? It is beyond our comprehension.
