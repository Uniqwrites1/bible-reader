Those who are trying to be justified by works don't ‘eagerly wait’ for anything; the future accounting is a source of apprehension.

The verb is in the middle voice, hence reflexive; it means to ‘sever’ or ‘amputate’, but can also mean to ‘exclude’. I take it Paul is wishing that they would ‘amputate’ or exclude themselves from the situation—he wants them to go away and leave the Galatian believers in peace!","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":12}},{"noteId":1544,"caller":"+","text":"In the context Paul is referring to that part of the law that deals with interacting with other human beings (not the part that deals with interacting with God).","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":14}},{"noteId":1545,"caller":"+","text":"What the flesh wants is bad for you; what the Spirit wants is good for you.
