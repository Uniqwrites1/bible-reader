In John 20:21 Sovereign Jesus said, “As the Father has sent me, I also send you”. So we are here to undo Satan's works—there is certainly no lack of opportunity or challenge! However, Satan does not take kindly to any such attempt, so you need to know who you are in Christ, and be living in submission to the Holy Spirit.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":8}},{"noteId":43,"caller":"+","text":"This statement appears to be so contrary to our experience that it has given rise to all sorts of evasive action. When explaining this verse in a church I ask all who have been born of God to raise a hand (raising my own)—most do. I then ask, “When were you born of God, from your mother's womb?” “Oh no”, they will say, “it was when I was saved/born again.” I then ask for a volunteer who was saved as an adult—‘John Doe’ offers, saying he was saved when he was 30. So I say, “Tell me, John, for the first 29 years of your life you were John Doe, right? Your family, your friends, everybody knew you.” “That's right.” “So when you were saved at 30 did you stop being John Doe? Nobody knows you any more?” “Everybody still knows me.” “So for 29 years you were John Doe and you continue to be John Doe?” “That's right.” “Okay, so what do you have that was born of God? It can't be anything that was there during the first 29 years.” Well, the answers will vary according to the theological sophistication of the person, but the Bible speaks of a ‘new man’ or ‘new nature’ that the Holy Spirit produces in us. It is that new nature that is God's “seed” within us, and that seed cannot sin. But the old nature still exists, and it does indeed sin—recall the Apostle Paul's struggle (Romans 7:13-25).","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":9}},{"noteId":44,"caller":"+","text":"Satan got Cain.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":12}},{"noteId":45,"caller":"+","text":"“The death” refers to Satan's kingdom; “the life” refers to Christ's Kingdom.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":14}},{"noteId":46,"caller":"+","text":"Some 4% of the Greek manuscripts omit “his brother” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.).","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":14}},{"noteId":47,"caller":"+","text":"Note the “is hating”—someone who murdered in the past can repent and be saved.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":15}},{"noteId":48,"caller":"+","text":"Well, the heart is ‘deceitful above all things’ (Jeremiah 17:9), so presumably Satan can use it to accuse us falsely, but the Righteous Judge has all the facts.
