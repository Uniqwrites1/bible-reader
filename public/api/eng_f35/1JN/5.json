And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one.” The words in italics are only found in five late Greek manuscripts (less than 1% of the total) and part of the Latin tradition, from which they came. To be more precise, the manuscripts are: (61)[16th], (629)[14th], (918)[16th], 2318 [18th], 2473 [17th], wherein the cursives in ( ) all differ from each other; the two that agree verbatim with TR were probably copied from it. The only one that is clearly early enough to have served as TR's exemplar, 629, is far too different—it lacks the seven last words in TR, omits another five, changes five and adds two—19 out of 40 words is too much; the Textus Receptus is not based on cursive 629, so it must be a translation from the Latin (or its exemplar is lost). The shorter reading makes excellent sense.

Well, ‘the wages of sin is death’, both physical and spiritual. Christ's sacrifice can save us from spiritual death, but not the physical. So is John referring to a premature physical death? But verse 16 is about a “brother” sinning. Consider what is said in Hebrews 10:26-31. 26 Because, if we deliberately keep on sinning after having received the real knowledge of the Truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27 just a certain fearful anticipation of judgment and fierce fire that is ready to consume the hostiles. 28 Anyone who rejected Moses' law died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. 29 Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be deemed worthy who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has regarded as unholy the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace? 30 For we know Him who said, “ ‘Vengeance is up to me’, says the Lord, ‘I will repay’.” And again, “The Lord will judge His people.” 31 It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God! Note the ‘after having received the real knowledge of the Truth’ and ‘by which he was sanctified’ (see also verses 32-36). I fear that what I was taught in Seminary on this subject does not square with the Text. I am not aware of any passage that spells out the sins that do and/or those that do not. I suppose that a request about a sin leading to death simply will not be granted. We ignore this area of truth at our peril.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":17}},{"noteId":75,"caller":"+","text":"This statement is very similar to the one in 3:9 above—please refer back to the note there.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":18}},{"noteId":76,"caller":"+","text":"Instead of “himself”, perhaps 8% of the Greek manuscripts have ‘him’ (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.).

Wherein might the “touch” in the Text consist? It cannot be temptation, because Christ Himself was tempted (Matthew 4:1-11); it cannot be an attack on the body, because the Apostle Paul was so attacked (2 Corinthians 12:7); it cannot be an attack on the mind, because the Apostle Peter was so attacked (Matthew 16:22-23). So wherein might the “touch” consist? Consider Ephesians 6:12—“our wrestling match” is against wicked spirits (wrestling is direct, physical, violent—it is impossible to be in a wrestling match and not be ‘touched’). Consider also 1 Peter 5:8—why ‘be vigilant’ if that lion cannot touch us? You may be absolutely certain that believers can be and are demonized! The crucial thing is a conscious submission to the Holy Spirit (while controlled by the Spirit you will never be controlled by a demon). But just who is it that the evil one does not touch? The one begotten by God, or born of God—but who is the “born of God”? Since only Jesus was literally born of God from His mother's womb, the rest of us receive the ‘new man’ at regeneration, so the believer as a whole person is not in view. Please refer back to the note at 3:9 above.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":18}},{"noteId":78,"caller":"+","text":"The verb ‘lie’ here is used for lying on a bed—your whole weight is resting on it.
