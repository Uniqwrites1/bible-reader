Were you aware that the “your” refers to Philemon while the “you” refers to the congregation? [The MSS evidence is about evenly divided between “you” and ‘us’, but I follow the best line of transmission, as in AV and NKJV.] The verse usually ends with “you/us in Christ Jesus”, but the preposition is properly “into”, which does not make for smooth English. The reference is to those who have believed into Jesus (as He Himself invariably said)—they were outside but have moved inside. So Paul is referring to a group of regenerated people and to the aggregate of ‘good things’ to be found among them; which I assume would certainly include the gifts of the Spirit, as well as His fruit. As Philemon's understanding of these resources increases, the sharing of his faith will become more powerful, and for this Paul prays. At the end of the verse, perhaps 2% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit “Jesus” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.).","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":6}},{"noteId":2679,"caller":"+","text":"Instead of “thanksgiving”, some 12% of the Greek manuscripts have ‘joy’, as in most versions.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":7}},{"noteId":2680,"caller":"+","text":"Paul starts out by asserting his authority, but softens it with an emotional appeal, appealing to Philemon's emotions in various ways.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":8}},{"noteId":2681,"caller":"+","text":"When not a proper name, the word is an adjective meaning ‘useful’.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":10}},{"noteId":2682,"caller":"+","text":"Some 1.5% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit “receive”, as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc., which obliges them to adjust their rendering accordingly.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":12}},{"noteId":2683,"caller":"+","text":"“Removed” is passive; Paul implies that God was behind the flight of Onesimus.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":15}},{"noteId":2684,"caller":"+","text":"What does “both in flesh and in the Lord” mean? Onesimus is now a brother in the Lord, but was he also Philemon's physical brother? But if a brother, how did he become his slave? I don't know. If I had to guess I would imagine that Philemon's father begot Onesimus of a slave woman. Whatever the messy consequences of people's lives without Christ, this letter illustrates nicely how the Gospel can straighten things out.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":16}},{"noteId":2685,"caller":"+","text":"Verses 17-19 are often used as an illustration of substitutionary atonement, wherein Philemon would represent the Father, Paul the Son, and Onesimus the sinner—what Onesimus owes is charged to Paul, so Onesimus can go free.
