So if your eye is sound your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is evil your whole body will be full of darkness. So if the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!” Of course we have two eyes, but the Text has “eye” in the singular. I take it that the reference is to the way we interpret what we see (which is our real ‘eye’)—two people, one pure and one vile, observing the same scene will give very different interpretations to it. ‘Evil’ here has the idea of malignant—aggressively evil. Someone with a malignant mind will give an evil interpretation to everything he sees, and in consequence his being will be filled with unrelenting darkness. That is what it says here in Titus 1:15; to someone who is defiled nothing is pure. With a defiled mind and conscience such a person is simply incapable of giving a decent interpretation to anything at all in this whole wide world. That is why Paul goes on to say in the next verse that such a person is disqualified for any good work. Surely, if you are full of evil, how can you do good?","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":15}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_f35/TIT/1.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/TIT/2.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/2TI/4.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":16}
