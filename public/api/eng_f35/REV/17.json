So a ‘father’ of that something would be even more so. So when James calls God “the Father of lights” (1:17) that means that “God is light and in Him is no darkness at all” (1 John 1:5)—He is totally light. In John 8:44 the Lord Jesus says that Satan is the father of the lie, and that “there is no truth in him”—he is totally falsehood (I conclude that it is impossible for Satan to tell the undistorted truth). Here we have “the mother of prostitutes and abominations”—she is totally perverted, evil (it is impossible for her to do anything pure, clean or really good). So whom or what does the whore represent? If the kings are fornicating with her they are not trying to please God, so perhaps she is organized religion (including dead Christianity, of whatever kind). In that event organized religion is incapable of doing anything pure, clean or really good.","reference":{"chapter":17,"verse":5}},{"noteId":2984,"caller":"+","text":"Well, the origin matches 11:7 but the description matches 13:1, so maybe the three passages refer to a single personage.
