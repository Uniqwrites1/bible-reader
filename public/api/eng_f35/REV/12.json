Assuming that the woman represents Israel, I imagine that these ‘stars’ are the tribal angels (because of the number twelve).","reference":{"chapter":12,"verse":1}},{"noteId":2933,"caller":"+","text":"It is generally understood that this refers to those angels who joined Lucifer in his rebellion—note that verse 7 refers to the dragon and his angels.

Since “Son” is obviously masculine, adding “a male” emphasizes the gender. What the first man lost the second Man (1 Corinthians 15:47) recovered; the first man allowed his wife to lead, the second Man will rule with a rod of iron.","reference":{"chapter":12,"verse":5}},{"noteId":2935,"caller":"+","text":"Here the Child is clearly identified as the Messiah—since He was born some 2,000 years ago we are obviously looking at an historical parenthesis. The rebellion of Lucifer and his angels goes back at least 6,000 years. We do not normally associate ‘shepherd’ with ‘a rod of iron’—the Messianic Millennial Kingdom will be a benevolent dictatorship.","reference":{"chapter":12,"verse":5}},{"noteId":2936,"caller":"+","text":"Verses 1-5 are historical, but verse 6 brings us back to the Great Tribulation.

The idea seems to be that at this point Satan is confined to this planet. From the content of the following verses I take it that Satan's expulsion occurs in the middle of the seven-year period. So he is still in heaven accusing us (accusing us of what? There would be no point in bringing false accusations, so we must be providing Satan with ‘ammunition’—not a nice thought!).","reference":{"chapter":12,"verse":9}},{"noteId":2939,"caller":"+","text":"Wait a minute! If it is only “Now”, where have the Kingdom and Authority been in the meantime? As long as a government is being challenged, its rule is not complete or tranquil.
