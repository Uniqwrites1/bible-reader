This text has been generally misunderstood since the beginning. Having been told to seal what the thunders uttered, why would John be told he would write it later? So many copyists altered the text, reinforcing the prohibition. However, I take it that the voice was giving two unrelated instructions: not to record the thunders; and to put his notebook aside until later—he is going to be busy interacting with the angel and eating a book, and the voice does not want him to be distracted by trying to write at the same time.","reference":{"chapter":10,"verse":4}},{"noteId":2914,"caller":"+","text":"“The days”—the events associated with a given trumpet (and probably seal and bowl) cover a period of time; they are not instantaneous.","reference":{"chapter":10,"verse":7}},{"noteId":2915,"caller":"+","text":"The action in verses 9-11 is presumably symbolic, but of what? Like why was the little book open, and why the stomach ache, etc.?

The book inside John suggests inspiration to me, and the terms of the prophecy would be mainly bitter.","reference":{"chapter":10,"verse":11}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_f35/REV/10.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/REV/11.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/REV/9.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":11}
