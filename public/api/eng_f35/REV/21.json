But in order to be the Boss at both the beginning and the end, you have to be the greatest, and survive all challenges. All human history has been involved in Satan's challenge of that supremacy. Because of that challenge, and because only at this point has that challenge been definitively put down, Jehovah the Son says, “I have become”.","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":6}},{"noteId":3024,"caller":"+","text":"Does it surprise you that “cowardly” is in this list? In Matthew 10:32-33 we read: “Everyone who will confess me before men, I will also confess him before my father who is in the heavens. But whoever should deny me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in the heavens.” See also Luke 12:8-9 and 1 John 2:23.

Anyone who caves in under pressure and disowns the Lord is out.","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":8}},{"noteId":3025,"caller":"+","text":"Both the TR and the so-called critical text omit “and sinners”, so most versions do as well, but two of the three main independent lines of transmission (including the best one) have the phrase.","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":8}},{"noteId":3026,"caller":"+","text":"That is what the Text says; instead of the noun ‘liar’ we find the adjective “false” (all the preceding descriptions are nouns, with one participle = “abominable”).","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":8}},{"noteId":3027,"caller":"+","text":"Actually the Text has “and”—John saw the visions in this order, but they will not necessarily happen in this order. I imagine that the New Jerusalem belongs to the Millennium (for reasons I will give below).","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":9}},{"noteId":3028,"caller":"+","text":"It seems to me to be unarguable that both Israel (the gates) and the Church (the foundations) participate in the New Jerusalem. (In fact, I imagine that the redeemed of all ages, up to the beginning of the Millennium, will be involved.) The rendering, “the woman [or, wife], the Lamb's bride”, is based on over half of the Greek manuscripts, two of the three main independent lines of transmission (including the best one). In Jeremiah 3:20 and Hosea 2 Israel is presented as the wife of Jehovah—but in the OT wherever God interacts directly with the human race it is always Jehovah the Son. Passages like Matthew 25:10, John 3:29, 2 Corinthians 11:2 and Ephesians 5:25-27, 31-32 point to the Church as the bride of Christ (who is Jehovah the Son). So here the two come together—the wife, the bride—but maintain a distinct identity (gates are one thing and foundations are another)—indeed, nowhere does the Bible ever confuse Israel and the Church (not even in Galatians 6:16, as I can demonstrate to anyone who wishes to pursue the matter). But if the Church is still a “bride”, then the wedding has not happened yet, which is my first reason for placing this scene at the beginning of the Millennium.","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":9}},{"noteId":3029,"caller":"+","text":"I wonder, who replaces the Iscariot? Besides the Twelve, the only one who was personally chosen by Jesus was Saul of Tarsus.","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":14}},{"noteId":3030,"caller":"+","text":"The evidence is badly divided here, but I take it that two of the three main independent lines of transmission (including the best one), do not add “and her wall”, which is read by most versions since both the TR and the so-called critical text so read. Two thousand years ago a city wall was a barrier to protect the city from attack, but the following context here makes clear that the wall was part of the structure. The city is a cube, like a modern high-rise, which is a recent concept in architecture. Many early copyists presumably assumed that the wall was distinct from the city and officiously altered the text. The angel measured precisely the city and her gates; see the next note.","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":15}},{"noteId":3031,"caller":"+","text":"Over half of the Greek manuscripts, two of the three main independent lines of transmission (including the best one), read “and twelve”—a surprising bit of precise detail. But consider—12,000 stadia, twelve gates—if the gates are evenly spaced, as seems likely, we have a thousand stadia between gates; or is it 1,001 stadia? I will argue below that each gate was one stadium wide, which nicely explains the precise number, twelve thousand and twelve!","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":16}},{"noteId":3032,"caller":"+","text":"The city is a cube, the total measurement being about 1,350 miles! But does it mean the circumference or is it referring to the three dimensions? If it refers to the circumference we divide by four and each side is about 340 miles long, and of course the height is also 340 miles. If we divide by three each dimension is about 450 miles. In either event, we have one incredibly large city! But because of the twelve gates and 12,000 stadia I really believe that the angel measured the circumference.","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":16}},{"noteId":3033,"caller":"+","text":"That is about 70 yards; since we already know that the wall is hundreds of miles high, the reference here must be to the thickness of the wall. I take it that the wall was part of the structure, like in a modern high-rise, not like a fence (with no enemies there is no need for a fence—in fact, verse 25 makes clear that even the gates will never be closed).","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":17}},{"noteId":3034,"caller":"+","text":"This is curious; apparently angels use the same measurement as humans.

But how were the twelve foundations arranged, piled up or side by side? Presumably the gates were evenly spaced, with 1,000 stadia between each pair, so perhaps each such space represented an Apostle and had a different precious stone.","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":20}},{"noteId":3037,"caller":"+","text":"Are not doors and gates usually wider than the wall is thick? The wall here is some 70 yards thick. I propose that each pearl was 200 yards (one stadium) wide (some pearl!), but notice in verse 25 that the gates were never closed, which means that they always remained in one position, hence no wear and tear on the ‘hinges’. But imagine that we are on that tremendously high mountain with John, and that we are perpendicular to the middle of one wall and at a distance of 50 miles. We are looking at a monstrous wall 340 miles square; it merely fills the horizon. At the base of the wall, evenly spaced (some 110 miles between them), are three gates. Would a gate 200 yards wide be out of proportion? Given the size of the wall, such gates might even seem small!","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":21}},{"noteId":3038,"caller":"+","text":"The ‘gold’ here is evidently different from the gold we know; John does not say that it looked like gold, he says it was gold.","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":21}},{"noteId":3039,"caller":"+","text":"“Kings of the earth”—we are still on the earth, with kings and nations coming and going, which is my second reason for placing the New Jerusalem during the Millennium.","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":24}},{"noteId":3040,"caller":"+","text":"That is, defiled or profane; perhaps anything not consecrated to God.","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":27}},{"noteId":3041,"caller":"+","text":"Connecting this statement with 22:15, we have all sorts of nasty people outside the city. After the Millennium and the Great White Throne they will be in the Lake of fire, so if they are still circulating on this earth, it must be during the Millennium, which is my third reason. Because of 22:15 I am inclined to suppose that the New Jerusalem will rest on the earth (not be a satellite, as some argue). But if so, where? The desert east of Jordan is hundreds of miles square with very few inhabitants, and relatively plane, yet quite close to the present Jerusalem.
