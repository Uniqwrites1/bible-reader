Here I think not—the Lord ‘has’ them like He has the seven stars. Perhaps the reference is to Isaiah 11:2.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":1}},{"noteId":2833,"caller":"+","text":"“That you were about to throw away” is the reading of about ⅔ of the Greek manuscripts, including the most dependable group, as opposed to ‘that were about to die’. They had probably already stopped believing in a variety of Biblical truths and were on the verge of dumping the rest, like the theological modernist or liberal of our day. Not surprisingly, they were short on works as well.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":2}},{"noteId":2834,"caller":"+","text":"See Luke 8:18.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":3}},{"noteId":2835,"caller":"+","text":"The Text is very clear—the glorified Christ said “erase”. You cannot erase something that is not there! To argue that Christ is using an impossibility as a threat is to accuse Him of using language deceitfully, a form of lying—not smart! By the grace of God my name is in the Book of Life, but what happens if I do not overcome? In all seven letters our risen Lord places heavy emphasis upon our human responsibility. God will take care of His side; we had better take a careful look at our side.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":5}},{"noteId":2836,"caller":"+","text":"Comparing this statement with Jesus' statement in Matthew 10:32-33, confessing is the opposite of denying. Since eternal destiny is at stake, the confessing/denying must involve what we are and do, not just our words. Confessing has to do with overcoming.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":5}},{"noteId":2837,"caller":"+","text":"The evidence is badly divided with reference to the wording of the last half of the verse. The translation given here reflects over half of the Greek manuscripts, including the most dependable group. We are accustomed to the more balanced form, but the basic point remains the same.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":7}},{"noteId":2838,"caller":"+","text":"I take it that this will happen here on earth—a pleasant prospect! Since they have been slandering us (at the very least, 2:9) this will be a welcome vindication. I imagine that at this point in history the “synagogue of Satan” includes people who claim to be Christians, but are not really. They may even be in positions of leadership (cf. Jeremiah 20:1-4).","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":9}},{"noteId":2839,"caller":"+","text":"There has always been tribulation and testing here and there on the earth, but to include “the whole inhabited earth” the reference must be to the Great Tribulation. How can you be “kept from the hour” if you are in the middle of it? To be protected in the middle of a situation is not the same as being kept from it. This text would appear to point toward a pre-tribulation, or pre-wrath, rapture of the Church.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":10}},{"noteId":2840,"caller":"+","text":"Would the glorified Christ make an empty threat?

The Lord is offering fellowship and communion to those who claim to belong to Him. Recall that the Father seeks those who will worship Him in spirit and truth (John 4:23). Many have the impression that God is hard to find or reach, but He disagrees: “You will seek me and find me, when you search for me with all your heart” (Jeremiah 29:13). The trouble is that few of us are willing to meet the condition.

Since the Son is now literally “seated” at the Father's right hand, this promise should be taken literally. But how about right now? I take it that we are supposed to be conducting ourselves on the basis of our position in Christ, on the basis of His victory and authority—maybe this has something to do with ‘overcoming’.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":21}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_f35/REV/3.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/REV/4.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/REV/2.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":22}
