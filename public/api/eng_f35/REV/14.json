If some four billion people will be killed during the seven-year period [mostly the second half of it] (as I calculate, a low estimate) and we allow an average of one gallon of blood per person, that is four billion gallons of blood—which would make quite a river! If the “winepress of God's terrible fury” described here represents sort of a summary of the blood shed during the Great Tribulation period, then the picture is not far fetched. Of course a winepress has a single outlet and the liquid is conveyed to the receptacle by a conduit of appropriate size. In this case the conduit is 180 miles long and the flow is about four feet (1.33 yards) deep—four billion gallons equals about 20 million cubic yards; 180 miles equals about 320 thousand linear yards; so we have about 62.5 cubic yards of blood per linear yard of conduit—so the conduit is about 45 yards wide. My purpose in conducting this exercise is simply to show that the description of the “winepress of God's terrible fury” is not at all ridiculous—it is a graphic but factual picture of the coming bloodbath.","reference":{"chapter":14,"verse":20}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_f35/REV/14.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/REV/15.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/REV/13.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":20}
