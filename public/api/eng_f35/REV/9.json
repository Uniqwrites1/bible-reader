Since it is a shaft or pit we presumably should understand no known or measured depth, hence ‘bottomless’. Literally, “the shaft of the no-bottom”; the familiar ‘bottomless pit’ is not a bad rendering. Since the word “abyss” occurs elsewhere without the “shaft/pit” (see verse 11, also Luke 8:31) I prefer to take it as a proper name.","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":1}},{"noteId":2901,"caller":"+","text":"It will not be a good time to be on the earth!","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":6}},{"noteId":2902,"caller":"+","text":"Evidently these are not the literal insect, but the insect came in clouds (millions of them) and was a terrible plague. Since they are lead by a high-ranking demon (as I suppose), they are probably demons. I associate Luke 8:31 with this passage—although the Lord evidently did not send those demons to the Abyss, that they kept begging Him not to shows that it was a very real possibility in their ‘minds’; they knew something that we do not. I take it that the Lord did not send them to the Abyss at that point because He had not won the victory yet—Satan was still the god of this world and the demons were doing their thing under Satan's authority. But now we are to act on the basis of that victory, on the basis of our position and authority in Christ (Ephesians 2:6). So how did all those demons get into the Abyss to be available for the fifth trumpet? They got there because we sent them there! I would say that sending demons to the Abyss is one of the ‘greater’ things that the Lord Jesus said we would do (John 14:12).","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":7}},{"noteId":2903,"caller":"+","text":"And in English, Destroyer. “Angel” covers both good and bad—this one sounds like a boss demon.","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":11}},{"noteId":2904,"caller":"+","text":"I find it to be curious that this voice comes from the altar [and why did the altars have horns?], which is usually associated with obtaining God's mercy.

Notice that it is the “horses” that do the killing, not the riders. I understand that China has over one hundred million armed militia, right now, but presumably not these ‘horses’. Just as in the case of the ‘locusts’, I take it that we are looking at supernatural activity here. The population of the world is reduced by one third.","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":18}},{"noteId":2907,"caller":"+","text":"Notice that the idols are linked to demons.

They are prepared to kill, steal and use witchcraft to gain their ends, with a total disregard for others. They want sexual gratification without responsibility. No matter what God does they will not repent; they are beyond fixing. I am glad I will not be there. Oops, wait a minute! Don't an awful lot of people in the world today (especially in Europe and North America) already answer to this description? They have been brought up on evolutionistic, relativistic humanism; they have been taught that they are gods, to ‘do your own thing’. Hey, if we are not already there I reckon we are well on the way!
