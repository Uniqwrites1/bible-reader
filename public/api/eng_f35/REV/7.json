However, the seals are broken in sequence.","reference":{"chapter":7,"verse":1}},{"noteId":2884,"caller":"+","text":"The Text says “the four corners” and “the four winds”. Presumably from John's perspective the earth would look like a sphere (or a circle)—so perhaps the angels were strategically placed so as to control the whole planet. There are four basic wind patterns that influence most of the world—the north and south ‘trade winds’ and the north and south ‘prevailing westerlies’.","reference":{"chapter":7,"verse":1}},{"noteId":2885,"caller":"+","text":"“Joseph” stands for Ephraim. Since Levi is counted here (usually he isn't) and Joseph has two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, someone has to be dropped—Dan. From both Jacob (Genesis 49:16-17) and Moses (Deuteronomy 33:22) he got the least impressive ‘blessing’.","reference":{"chapter":7,"verse":8}},{"noteId":2886,"caller":"+","text":"Linguistically speaking, in terms of the norms of language, a phrase like “the tribe of Asher” can only have one meaning, precisely the meaning that it has everywhere else in the Bible.

When they see that they have been left behind they will fall on their faces before God saying: “Oh Lord, have mercy; if I never believed before I do now!” There will be many millions of conversions in the first hours after the Rapture. People were saved in the OT without the indwelling Holy Spirit, and they will be too. But they will have to face the Beast and most of them will be martyred. Notice that they say, “Saved by our God… and by the Lamb.” Apparently there is a sovereign act of God (the Father) involved here, with the blood of the Lamb as the basis.","reference":{"chapter":7,"verse":14}},{"noteId":2890,"caller":"+","text":"How does one “serve” in this sanctuary?
