In Deuteronomy 23:18 ‘dog’ apparently refers to a male prostitute, a catamite, and is declared to be an abomination. In OT times dogs were scavengers and therefore unclean, and were generally looked down upon. In Jesus' day Jews referred to Gentiles as ‘dogs’, but since many Gentiles are in the Church that is presumably not the intended meaning here. The ‘dogs’ in Matthew 7:6 react in an aggressively hostile manner against what is holy; I take it that they are people who are overtly serving evil (Philippians 3:2 may be referring to this sort of person). So who are the ‘dogs’ here? At the very least they are the unclean.
