At first glance the context seems to call for ‘sanctuary’; so much so that if ‘heaven’ were original some might have omitted while others made the obvious change—if ‘sanctuary’ were original, why would anyone omit or change? On the other hand, there are at least three heavens, 2 Corinthians 12:2, and they may have come out of the third, into the second. This is the only mention of the tabernacle of the testimony in Revelation, so the throne of God was not there and none of the action related by John up to this point took place there—there have been several references to the temple, with angels coming out of it, but I doubt that temple and tabernacle are to be equated.","reference":{"chapter":15,"verse":6}},{"noteId":2973,"caller":"+","text":"Just like the glorified Christ (1:13).
