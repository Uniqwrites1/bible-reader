The etymology of the word suggests ‘laity conquerors’, perhaps the beginning of the system where the clergy dominates the laity. Once someone has a ‘guaranteed’ position their lifestyle often becomes licentious.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":6}},{"noteId":2802,"caller":"+","text":"That is right, just one ear. In other words, we had better pay attention!","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":7}},{"noteId":2803,"caller":"+","text":"At this point it becomes very clear that God is giving a general application to these letters. The first one was written to a literal church in literal Ephesus, in literal terms, but all of us are to pay attention to the spiritual principles and lessons involved.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":7}},{"noteId":2804,"caller":"+","text":"So what happens if you do not overcome??","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":7}},{"noteId":2805,"caller":"+","text":"The Tree of Life is first mentioned in Genesis 3:22-24; it must have been transplanted out of the Garden of Eden before the Flood, unless it was a replica of the original in God's Paradise. A considerable majority of the Greek manuscripts, including the best line of transmission, have “my” God. While walking this earth the Son repeatedly referred to the Father as ‘my God’.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":7}},{"noteId":2806,"caller":"+","text":"Here, and in 1:17 and 22:13, the glorified Christ calls Himself “the First and the Last”—comparing with Isaiah 44:6 we have one of several demonstrations that Jesus Christ is Jehovah [Mormons and JWs deny that He is Jehovah].","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":8}},{"noteId":2807,"caller":"+","text":"You had better believe that there is a ‘synagogue of Satan’ near you!

Also there is no incentive to pretend.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":10}},{"noteId":2810,"caller":"+","text":"Revelation 20:14 makes clear that “the second death” is the Lake of Fire. The first death is the physical one; the second is the spiritual one—eternal separation from the Creator, in whose image we are. Of course the redeemed go into eternal life, not death, so the “second death” holds no threat for them. But there is the little matter of ‘overcoming’.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":11}},{"noteId":2811,"caller":"+","text":"I find the double reference to Satan here to be curious. The opposition in the spirit realm would be especially strong.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":13}},{"noteId":2812,"caller":"+","text":"Why are fornication and adultery becoming more and more common in ‘Christian’ circles today? They come with idolatry—the church is riddled with humanism, relativism, materialism, spiritism, etc., false gods all. One wonders how many Christians today have a world view that is strictly Biblical, without any admixture of the world's values.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":14}},{"noteId":2813,"caller":"+","text":"Birds of a feather flock together; if you start sinning in one area, before long it is two.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":15}},{"noteId":2814,"caller":"+","text":"Notice that the pronoun changes—it is specifically against the Nicolaitans and Balaamites that He will fight.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":16}},{"noteId":2815,"caller":"+","text":"“From” is literal, maybe too literal; perhaps we should render “some of” the hidden manna.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":17}},{"noteId":2816,"caller":"+","text":"Our name identifies us to other people, so what good is a name that no one knows? Except that the giver knows, obviously. So maybe the private name has to do with a private relationship, between giver and receiver!

Yes, well, but, then there is the rest of the story.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":19}},{"noteId":2820,"caller":"+","text":"About three fourths of the Greek manuscripts, including the best line of transmission, read “your wife” rather than ‘that woman’. The main group that reads ‘that woman’ reflects a tradition that is full of obvious corruptions, and so does not inspire confidence. The original reading is doubtless “your wife”. To have a wife the messenger must be a man, not an angel.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":20}},{"noteId":2821,"caller":"+","text":"The Lord uses an emphatic possessive pronoun here—she is messing with His slaves.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":20}},{"noteId":2822,"caller":"+","text":"Again, notice that fornication and idolatry go together.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":20}},{"noteId":2823,"caller":"+","text":"If someone refuses to repent they are beyond help; judgment has to come.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":21}},{"noteId":2824,"caller":"+","text":"Two thirds of the Greek manuscripts, including the most dependable group, have “her” works, not ‘their’ works. In verse 20 the Lord emphasized that they were His slaves. If the original reading is “her” works, as I believe, then what is involved here is spiritual adultery—she was not literally sleeping with a variety of men in the church. No matter how much love, faith and service there may be in a church, the Lord will not tolerate idolatry, which is spiritual adultery.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":22}},{"noteId":2825,"caller":"+","text":"Literally ‘kill by death’—so how else can you kill someone if not by death? Those who are familiar with the KJV will recall the phrase ‘let him die the death’, which in the context implies execution. I take it that “her children” does not refer to her literal sons and daughters, but to her ‘spiritual children’, those who have bought into her teaching and life style. The Lord wants to eradicate her ‘genes’, as it were. But why does God not kill Jezebel herself, instead of her children? I imagine that God uses evil people, like Jezebel, to put the rest of us to the test, to see whose side we really are on. Those who go along with a ‘Jezebel’ don't really want God.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":23}},{"noteId":2826,"caller":"+","text":"What we do, or do not do, not only makes a difference down here, but will also make a difference ‘up there’.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":23}},{"noteId":2827,"caller":"+","text":"“Known” implies experiential knowledge. Note that the Lord links Jezebel's teaching directly to Satan, and those who are doing it are deeply involved with him (whether or not they fully understand the implications—if they are ‘deceived’ [v. 20] then they may indeed not understand).","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":24}},{"noteId":2828,"caller":"+","text":"They were doing quite well, generally—see the second note with verse 19 above. So if they throw off Jezebel's influence they will be all right.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":25}},{"noteId":2829,"caller":"+","text":"“Keeps my works until the end”—it is not enough to hold to the right doctrine; the Lord wants to see us reproducing His works (John 14:12). Notice that our participation in the administration of the Messianic Millennial Kingdom is at stake.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":26}},{"noteId":2830,"caller":"+","text":"The Lord is evidently referring to Psalms 2:7-9. In that event He is declaring that He is the “Son” in verse7 and that He did indeed ask for and receive the nations as an inheritance. If we are coheirs (Romans 8:17) then we are involved in the outworking.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":28}},{"noteId":2831,"caller":"+","text":"In Revelation 22:16 the Lord declares Himself to be the “morning star”. In Isaiah 14:12 Satan is called “day-star, son of the morning”, but that was what he was before he fell. The planets Venus and Mercury are the ‘morning stars’ we see in the sky at dawn. But the Lord here says the morning star. I guess we will find out what He means when we get there.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":28}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_f35/REV/2.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/REV/3.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/REV/1.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":29}
