If a woman teaches her husband in church, crossing the street to their house will not make her want to submit to him; human nature does not work that way.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":12}},{"noteId":300,"caller":"+","text":"Paul appeals to God's purpose in Creation. God created the man first and gave him the responsibility to administer the earth. Later on He created the woman, using a part of the man's body, for the declared purpose of being his assistant (Genesis 2:18). An assistant does not give orders to the boss; nor does he make policy decisions on his own. The first woman did make a policy decision on her own, with catastrophic consequence.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":13}},{"noteId":301,"caller":"+","text":"As a general rule (there are exceptions) a man tends to think things through before reaching a decision, so he can defend his choice on the basis of logical argument. A woman tends to be more intuitive and will decide on that basis, without being able to defend the choice logically (which tends to frustrate men no end). Whether that was why Eve could be so easily deceived, I am not prepared to say, but Paul uses that susceptibility as an argument in his case against allowing women to teach. Doctrine must be based on reason, not intuition—to teach is to define. Paul affirms that Adam was not deceived, so his choice was deliberate. To disobey the Creator was a policy decision that Eve, as assistant, had no business making—she rebelled against the role that the Creator assigned her. Her fait accompli left Adam with a difficult decision—let her die alone, or die with her. It is idle to speculate on why he decided as he did, but it was Adam's choice (not Eve's) that condemned the race to ‘death through sin’ (Romans 5:12-21).","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":14}},{"noteId":302,"caller":"+","text":"Note that ‘she’ refers to Eve, she is the antecedent. Neither Eve nor any other woman is saved by bearing a child. ‘Childbirth’ is accompanied by the definite article, in the Text, so it is “the childbirth”. There is only one childbirth that could result in salvation for Eve, and the rest of us, the birth of the Messiah.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":15}},{"noteId":303,"caller":"+","text":"Paul breaks the rules of grammar and switches from ‘she’ to ‘they’ in the middle of the sentence—what is true of Eve is applied to all women. Well, strictly speaking, since “they” has no antecedent I suppose it could include men as well, everybody (unless someone wants to argue that women are saved on a different basis than men [which I think would run afoul of other passages]). Still, the paragraph is about women. Any sisters in Christ who have been troubled by this verse, thinking they must bear a child, may relax on that score.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":15}},{"noteId":304,"caller":"+","text":"So what happens if they do not “continue”?","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":15}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_f35/1TI/2.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/1TI/3.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/1TI/1.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":15}
