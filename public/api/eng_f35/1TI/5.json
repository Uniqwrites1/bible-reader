But for him to place Luke on a par with Moses is little short of incredible. Although there may have been close to twenty years between the ‘publishing’ of Luke and the writing of 1 Timothy, Luke was recognized and declared by apostolic authority to be Scripture not long after it came off the press, so to speak. But if Paul wrote this letter under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, as I believe, then God Himself is declaring Luke to be Scripture!","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":18}},{"noteId":339,"caller":"+","text":"It appears that Timothy was to act as a ‘deputy apostle’ (something like a deputy sheriff).","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":20}},{"noteId":340,"caller":"+","text":"Perhaps 5% of the Greek manuscripts omit “Sovereign” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.).","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":21}},{"noteId":341,"caller":"+","text":"I wonder what the angels have to do with it.
