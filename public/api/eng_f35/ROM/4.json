Psalm 2:7-8 also clearly refers to the Christ: “I will declare the decree: the Lord has said to Me, ‘You are My Son, today I have begotten You. Ask of Me, and I will give You the nations for your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for your possession.’ ” It might be argued that in some sense this is happening through the Church, Christ's body—in Matthew 5:13-14 the Christ called His disciples “the salt of the earth” and “the light of the world”. Paul states, “all things are yours… and you are Christ's… and Christ is God's” (1 Corinthians 3:21-23).
