In 1 Corinthians 15:31 he said that he died every day. Paul could not have been referring to actual physical death, obviously, since Hebrews 9:27 affirms that it is appointed to men to die only once (no reincarnation). He may well have faced possible death often enough, but I suppose he is referring to dying to himself. I suppose this is also the meaning of our Lord's words in Luke 9:23-24—“If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.” In that day a cross was an instrument of death. We must die to our own will in order to embrace God's. To present the body is presumably a metonym for presenting one's whole self.","reference":{"chapter":12,"verse":1}},{"noteId":3244,"caller":"+","text":"‘The pattern of this world’ belongs to Satan, so it must be rejected in order to do God's will.
