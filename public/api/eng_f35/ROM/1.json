According to 2 Thessalonians 2:10-11, to reject the love of the truth brings God's judgment. To hear a sermon about ‘the love of God’ is easy enough, but how many have you heard (or preached) about ‘the wrath of God’? “God hates sin but loves the sinner” is standard fare, but consider Psalm 5:4-6—“For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, nor shall evil dwell with You. The boastful shall not stand in your sight; You hate all workers of iniquity. You shall destroy those who speak falsehood; the Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.” This is not an isolated text; there are a fair number of others in the same vein. Someone who deliberately chooses to be and promote evil thereby makes God his enemy. In John 6:44 Sovereign Jesus said: “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.” Do you suppose that the Father will ‘draw’ someone He hates? Perhaps we should do more preaching on the wrath of God (although that will probably send people scurrying to other churches).","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":18}},{"noteId":3073,"caller":"+","text":"All scientific experiment and true human knowledge is based on the principle of cause and effect—we observe an effect and try to isolate its cause. As a logical corollary, the cause must be as great or greater than the effect, otherwise it could not produce it. Any human being who is both honest and intelligent, confronted with the observable universe, with its incredible order and complexity, must conclude that there has to be a CAUSE who is both incredibly intelligent and powerful—to refuse to do so is perverse. Since we have personality, He must as well. So Paul's argument is precisely correct. The science of physics tells us that the entire known universe, taking only what is inorganic (not part of any living system), can be described using up to 350 bits of information. To describe the smallest protein molecule (unable to live alone, but part of a living system) requires some 1,500 bits of information (the E. coli bacterium some 7 million; one human cell some 20 billion). Now just where could chance plus nothing find 1,150 bits of new information (to produce the simplest protein), if in the whole universe there was only 350? The evolutionary hypothesis as an explanation for the origin of life is ridiculously, stupidly impossible! The science of genetics, with its genome projects, has discovered that a change of just 3 nucleotides is usually fatal to the organism. The genetic difference between a human being and a chimpanzee (closest relative) is at least 1.6%—this represents a gap of some 48 million nucleotide differences. Since a random change of only 3 nucleotides is fatal to an animal, and a dead animal cannot reproduce, there is no possible way that a chimp could evolve into a human. Each individual species had to be assembled separately, just like Genesis says. The ‘geologic column’ is a fiction, since there are multistrate tree fossils. Symbiotic plants and insects could not possibly evolve. And so on.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":20}},{"noteId":3074,"caller":"+","text":"To turn against the Creator, to deny His existence, is a deliberate, culpable choice, since it goes against the observable scientific evidence.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":21}},{"noteId":3075,"caller":"+","text":"When you deliberately turn out the light, you condemn yourself to grope about in darkness, and you cannot see what is attacking you. ‘Were darkened’ is in the passive voice, so the necessary question is, by what or by whom? Ephesians 2:2 refers to Satan as “the spirit who now works in the sons of the disobedience”. When someone rejects the Creator he also rejects His protection; by choosing to become a ‘son of the disobedience’, a person invites Satan into his mind, and Satan brings darkness. I am reminded of our Lord's words in Matthew 6:22-23. “The lamp of the body is the eye. So if your eye is sound your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is evil your whole body will be full of darkness. So if the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!” Of course we have two eyes, but the Text has “eye” in the singular. I take it that the reference is to the way we interpret what we see (which is our real ‘eye’)—two people, one pure and one vile, observing the same scene will give very different interpretations to it. “Evil” here has the idea of malignant—aggressively evil. Someone with a malignant mind will give an evil interpretation to everything he sees, and in consequence his being will be filled with unrelenting darkness. Cf. Titus 1:15.","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":21}},{"noteId":3076,"caller":"+","text":"‘Modern man’ struts about, thinking that he is smarter than former generations.

All the evil in the world is a consequence of men's evil choices—God should not be blamed. That said, however, any time a person chooses evil he invites Satan into his mind, and Satan will push the person toward ever lower levels of depravity. I believe that Hebrews 2:7 is relevant here: “You made him [man, verse 6] lower than the angels, for a little while” (quoting Psalm 8:5). The human being is superior to the angelic being in essence; we bear the Creator's image and they do not, and once glorified that superiority will be obvious, but only for the redeemed. Those who serve Satan subordinate themselves to him, and thus can never rise above him. If Lucifer's rebellion was provoked, as I suppose, by the creation of a being superior to himself, he is doing very well at getting his ‘revenge’, by depriving the vast majority of humanity of that superiority [and so Hebrews 2:8 would not apply to them]. Satan is now controlled by spite; he was demoted. Since he is unable to create, he gets his satisfaction by degrading and destroying. His greatest ‘pleasure’ must be to drag the image of the Creator through the mire, and for that purpose anal sex is just the ticket. Since it is a man's seed that transmits the ‘image’ (see Hebrews 7:10, etc.), anal sex mixes the image of God with feces—a monstrous insult! The practice of anal sex is the equivalent of spitting in the face of the Creator; it is an extremely serious offense (worse than a buck private spitting in the face of a four star general). So then, as soon as God removes His hand, Satan pushes men toward anal sex, thereby making it increasingly difficult for them to ever be saved (as verses 26-32 below make clear).","reference":{"chapter":1,"verse":25}},{"noteId":3079,"caller":"+","text":"If God gives you up, you are in a bad way!
