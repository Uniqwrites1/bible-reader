But Paul is a Jew, and they like to repeat things. In Romans 7:14-23 Paul described the conflict of the two natures within himself—he was not ‘home free’. That he is not through with the topic is clear from verses 5-17 below, where he describes in detail the conflict between flesh and Spirit. The reader may rest assured that the 97% are correct. Anyone who insists on walking according to the flesh will discover that there is indeed condemnation.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":1}},{"noteId":3171,"caller":"+","text":"Less than 1% of the Greek manuscripts read ‘you’ singular, to be followed by NASB and LB. But ‘you’ in English is ambiguous as to number, and neither NASB nor LB tells the reader that ‘you’ is singular (because in the context it is obviously wrong). Both versions favor the reader with a footnote informing that “some” manuscripts read “me” [their way of referring to 700 against 4, which to my mind is a dishonest use of language].","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":2}},{"noteId":3172,"caller":"+","text":"The sin in our flesh having been condemned, it is now possible to walk according to the Spirit.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":3}},{"noteId":3173,"caller":"+","text":"This is a ‘genetic’ incapability, so we need a new birth.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":8}},{"noteId":3174,"caller":"+","text":"Where, down here? If it is “because of His Spirit who dwells [present tense] in you”, presumably so. Consider 1 Thessalonians 5:23—“Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” I take it that the grammatical structure of this phrase, “the spirit and the soul and the body” (in Greek), demands a tripartite/trichotomous view of the human being. I confess that I have trouble imagining complete sanctification for the body, in this life, but there it is. Still, verse 11 here does not demand ‘complete’ sanctification; obviously we use our mortal bodies as we serve God down here, and the more we use them to serve God, the more sanctified they will be.","reference":{"chapter":8,"verse":11}},{"noteId":3175,"caller":"+","text":"In these verses we have ‘Spirit of God’, ‘Spirit of Christ’, ‘Spirit’ and ‘Spirit of Him who raised Jesus’; so how many spirits or persons are there?
