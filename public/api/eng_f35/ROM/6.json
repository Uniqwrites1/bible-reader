We have already seen in Romans 2:25-29 that Paul rejects that notion—God looks on the heart. In our day there are those who think that the physical rite of water baptism is a similar passport, but we probably all know individuals who had their ‘bath’ and are now living for Satan—God looks on the heart. 1 Corinthians 12:12-13 explains that it is the Holy Spirit who baptizes us into Christ: “…so also is Christ. For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body.” If we become part of Christ's body, then whatever happens to that body happens to us. If that body died, we did. If it was buried, so were we. If it was raised from the dead, we will be too. Correction—we already have new life in Christ, and are to live on that basis.","reference":{"chapter":6,"verse":3}},{"noteId":3152,"caller":"+","text":"Literally ‘man’.

Consider Hebrews 6:4-6: “Because, it is impossible to bring back into repentance those who were once for all enlightened, who have partaken of the heavenly gift and were made sharers in the Holy Spirit, 5 who have experienced God's good event and capabilities of the coming age, 6 and yet have fallen away—they would be crucifying the Son of God all over again, just for themselves, holding Him up to contempt.” No amount of theological shifting and squirming can nullify the plain meaning of verse 6. The only way to crucify Jesus again is if you have already done so once before. No one is going to kill Jesus twice; if the first time was not good enough for you, you have had it! As He Himself said in John 10:17-18: “Therefore my Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.” He laid it down once, freely, but that is all.","reference":{"chapter":6,"verse":9}},{"noteId":3156,"caller":"+","text":"Some 3.5% of the Greek manuscripts omit “our Lord”, to be followed by NIV, NASB, TEV, LB, etc.—an inferior proceeding.","reference":{"chapter":6,"verse":11}},{"noteId":3157,"caller":"+","text":"Literally, ‘the members’.","reference":{"chapter":6,"verse":13}},{"noteId":3158,"caller":"+","text":"Recall the note about slaves at Romans 1:1.","reference":{"chapter":6,"verse":18}},{"noteId":3159,"caller":"+","text":"Sin, and mere gratification of physical desire, obey the law of diminishing returns.
