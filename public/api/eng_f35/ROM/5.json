If sin is not ‘imputed’, why is there death? The verb ‘imputed’ refers to an account made up of a list of specific items. If I run up a bill at a local store, when I meet the owner on the street we both know I'm in debt, even without an itemized bill in hand. The debt affects our relationship, and may affect my standing in the community, and that of my family, etc.—the consequences derive from the fact, not the itemized list. So “death reigned from Adam to Moses” based on the fact of sin, not on an itemized list. “The wages of sin is death”, so since we are sinners by inclination (birth) and choice, death reigns. Although there is no explicit instruction about animal sacrifice in the first chapters of Genesis, it is implied. For God to accept Abel's sacrifice and reject Cain's, there must have been instruction about such things (Genesis 4:3-5). Indeed, God had given the example by killing an animal to cover the nakedness of the fallen pair (Genesis 3:21). In Genesis 8:20-21 the implication is clear that Noah knew what he was supposed to do. And Job, who lived before Abraham (presumably), knew about sacrifice for sin (Job 1:5).","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":14}},{"noteId":3144,"caller":"+","text":"As a transgressor, Adam is not a type of Christ, so I take the reference to be to ‘the man of sin’.
