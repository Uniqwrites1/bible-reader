The rest said, ‘Let him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save him’.” The ‘let him’ is 2nd person singular. But in Mark's account, the ‘let him’ is 2nd person plural! How do we reconcile the two accounts? I suggest the following: First, the man was quite possibly Mark himself; next, anyone who really understood the language would know that Jesus had not called Elijah; so, he responds sarcastically to their erroneous interpretation and therefore unreasonable demand that he stop; he retorts, “You stop!” and repeats their interpretation in disgust.","reference":{"chapter":15,"verse":36}},{"noteId":2659,"caller":"+","text":"Both Matthew 27:50 and John 19:30 plainly state that Jesus dismissed His spirit.

He knew that a cross killed by asphyxiation. Hanging from the hands, with the arms stretched out, pushes the diaphragm against the lungs so you can't breathe. Nailing the feet was a sadistic procedure to prolong the agony—even though painful, the victim would push up so he could get a breath, until finally too worn out to do so. Breaking the legs would put an end to that expedient, and the person died within a few minutes, asphyxiated. Someone who is dying asphyxiated does not shout. Since Jesus gave a loud shout, but then immediately died, the centurion knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that the cross had not killed Jesus (later, when Joseph asks for the body, Pilate is surprised that Jesus could already be dead). But who can just tell his spirit to leave? Putting two and two together, the centurion concluded that Jesus was a supernatural being. Just so!","reference":{"chapter":15,"verse":39}},{"noteId":2663,"caller":"+","text":"As soon as Jesus died, the centurion most probably had left the scene, going back to headquarters.
