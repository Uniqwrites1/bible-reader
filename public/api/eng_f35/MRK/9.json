Demons will do anything to deceive, confuse or demoralize us. If you resist a spirit, he leaves, but another may immediately take the place of the first and produce the same effect, making you think that nothing happened, so that you feel demoralized. If you resist but do not forbid a return, he leaves but may come back, in an hour, a day or a week. If I have to rebuke the enemy I now rebuke not only the spirit actually at work but any and all others that might wish to attack the person in the same way. I used to forbid any repetition of the attack, but now I send them to the Abyss. I believe Luke 8:31 give us basis for consigning demons to the Abyss, thereby reducing the number of the enemy's forces (against us). There we read that the demons begged Jesus “not to order them to go into the Abyss” (“the Abyss” is the same phrase that the AV renders as “the bottomless pit” in Revelation 20:1). That means that He could have—I conclude that He refrained from doing so because He had not yet won the victory, at that time. But now it is different. In John 14:12 the Lord Jesus said to His disciples: “Most assuredly I say to you, he who believes into me, the works that I do he will do also; even greater works than these he will do, because I go to my Father.” What does “because I go to my Father” imply? I conclude that it must be His victory—could He have returned if He had failed, if He had not succeeded in destroying the devil (Hebrews 2:14)? That is why we are supposed to be doing “greater” works—like ordering demons into the Abyss, for instance. C. Fred Dickason, who has personally ministered to over 400 demonized believers, says that his experience indicates that once a demon is ordered into the Abyss it does not come back (Demon Possession & the Christian, Moody Press, 1987). Paul E. Billheimer says much the same in Destined to Overcome (Bethany House Publishers, 1982, p. 46). Can you imagine if God's people really got a hold on this? We could continuously reduce the number of demons opposing us! Hallelujah! So then, why not order all recalcitrant demons into the Abyss? In fact, why not do the same for any and all that intrude upon our notice?","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":25}},{"noteId":2507,"caller":"+","text":"Four Greek manuscripts (all inferior), against 1651, omit ‘and fasting’, to be followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":29}},{"noteId":2508,"caller":"+","text":"This seems to us to be an awkward expression, but that is what the Text says.","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":31}},{"noteId":2509,"caller":"+","text":"Around 1.5% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit ‘one who doesn't follow us’, to be followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":38}},{"noteId":2510,"caller":"+","text":"Instead of ‘you’, some 10% of the Greek manuscripts have ‘us’ (both times) (to be followed by NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.).","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":40}},{"noteId":2511,"caller":"+","text":"But how and where could an unbeliever be ‘rewarded’?

Obviously it would be better to pluck out an eye, literally, if it would stop you in time, than to fall from the Faith and wind up in the Lake. In the first place, most people are not prepared to take such drastic measures, and in the second, by the time they wake up to what is happening, they have already crossed the line. That is why Hebrews 3:12-14 is precisely to the point: “Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; but exhort one another daily, while it is called ‘Today’, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
