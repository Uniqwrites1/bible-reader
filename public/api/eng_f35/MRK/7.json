Consider: a) In explaining His lack of response to the woman's pleading, Jesus affirms that He was only sent to “the lost sheep of the house of Israel” (Matthew 15:24)—so what is He doing in Gentile territory? b) The Text says He tried to get into a house without being seen; it follows that the group had kept a low profile, trying to avoid attention; and yet the woman intercepted Him well before He got there, and followed, crying out repeatedly (thereby blowing His ‘cover’)—so how did the woman learn of His presence, how did she know when and where to go, and how did she know to address Him as ‘Son of David’? c) Although He may have done more than is recorded, and we do not know how long He stayed, expelling that demon is all that is recorded—so why did He undertake that journey, apparently the only side trip to that region? I suspect that this was a special case, similar to Cornelius, or the Ethiopian treasurer—she had gotten God's attention, somehow. I imagine that an angel told her where to go, and when, and to call Him, ‘Son of David’ (Messiah). Of course she gave us an unusual example of faith, humility and perseverance, but I wonder if God is not telling us something more: it is possible to get a ‘crumb’ (a real need), even when it is not the proper time frame (καιρος)."]},{"type":"verse","number":24,"content":["Then He got ready and went from there into the region of Tyre and Sidon.
