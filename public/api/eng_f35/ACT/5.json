One way is to harbor an attitude contrary to God's will and character.","reference":{"chapter":5,"verse":3}},{"noteId":854,"caller":"+","text":"As the context makes clear, the problem was that Ananias lied. He wanted the credit for doing like the others, but he was hedging his bet. If he had honestly stated that it was only a part, he would have lived on.

This would appear to be one of the “greater things” of John 14:12, since we have no record of Jesus using His shadow.
