James is addressing Christian Jews, and their culture is very strong. For many generations they have called their meeting places ‘synagogues’, so why stop now?

The translations that close the quote after the first ‘works’ do not make sense. The hypothetical objector has disclaimed faith, so for James to say, “Show me your faith”, does not follow. James clearly teaches salvation by faith, a faith that is alive (if you are alive, you do things). But an orthodox Jew believes in salvation by works, so here James (who had once been one) anticipates an objection from that quarter. The salvation-by-works person has a different faith.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":18}},{"noteId":1793,"caller":"+","text":"In his retort James cites a central tenet in Judaism.
