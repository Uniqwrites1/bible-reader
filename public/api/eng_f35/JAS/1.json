I believe Paul Billheimer (Don't Waste Your Sorrows) has given us a handle on a basic truth—the only way a human being can learn αγαπη love is through suffering. And the mainspring of God's Kingdom is αγαπη love, and God wants to prepare His servants for their responsibilities in the next world. So the lessons God wants us to learn come wrapped in unpleasant circumstances; but if we refuse a given lesson our spiritual growth stops. Further, sooner or later that lesson will return, and will keep on returning until we learn, or die (which is why Billheimer says, “don't waste your sorrows”, because if we don't learn the first time we will have wasted that suffering).
