Since none of us can literally go to the Lake of Fire and dip our tongue in it, this must be figurative—a case of metonymy. With what, or whom, is hell most closely associated? In Matthew 25:4 Sovereign Jesus affirms that the Lake was “prepared for the devil and his angels”. Apparently the antichrist and the false prophet will be the first residents (Revelation 19:20), followed a thousand years later by Satan, presumably along with his angels (Revelation 20:10). The defiling, destructive activity of the tongue is the result of demonic participation.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":6}},{"noteId":1801,"caller":"+","text":"Instead of “uncontrollable”, less than 3% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, have ‘restless’ (as in NIV, NASB, etc.).","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":8}},{"noteId":1802,"caller":"+","text":"Notice the violence of the description of the tongue—“organization of wickedness”, “defiles the whole body”, “uncontrollable evil”, “deadly poison”—it would be difficult to be more emphatic. Obviously James is describing something extraordinary. One of Satan's most effective ways of lousing up our lives is by causing us to say things that we should not, and that by ourselves we would not. By this means he turns our homes, our schools, our work places into places of contention instead of peace. “No one among men is able to tame the tongue”—an unaided human being is presumably incapable of escaping from demonic attack, but the Holy Spirit can indeed tame our tongue, if we let Him.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":8}},{"noteId":1803,"caller":"+","text":"Instead of “God”, perhaps 4% of the Greek manuscripts have ‘the Lord’ (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.).","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":9}},{"noteId":1804,"caller":"+","text":"See note at 1:27 above.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":9}},{"noteId":1805,"caller":"+","text":"In nature this does not happen—if it ever did it would mean that there were two veins of different water meeting just below the opening of the spring.
