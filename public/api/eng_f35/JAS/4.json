I would rather hear, “Rejoice in the Lord always…” So what does James want? Well, all along his letter has been an exercise in ‘tough love’; we have seen “filthiness and overflow of evil”, “malignant thoughts”, “foolish fellow”, “uncontrollable evil, full of deadly poison”, “bitter envy and selfish ambition”, “unruliness and every foul practice”, “adulterers and adulteresses”, “enemy of God”—all in all, not a pretty picture. I take it that James is saying that we have a long way to go in our spiritual growth. There is no room for spiritual pride or self-contentedness, or a conquering hero complex; if we really want to walk with God we need to fall on our faces before Him, put our mouth in the dust—in short, try to see our sin as He sees it.","reference":{"chapter":4,"verse":9}},{"noteId":1818,"caller":"+","text":"If we exalt ourselves, God knocks us down; if we humble ourselves, He lifts us up—I imagine that just how far up He lifts us depends on a variety of factors.","reference":{"chapter":4,"verse":10}},{"noteId":1819,"caller":"+","text":"Some 62% of the Greek manuscripts, including the best line of transmission, read “Lawgiver and Judge”.

I personally do not enjoy dealing with ‘brothers’ who are too different; I would rather question whether they are really ‘brothers’ at all! But James tells me not to do that. Each person is different (background, experiences, personality, training) and we must recognize that God can and will deal differently with different people. He uses one ‘law’ with me, another ‘law’ with you, and so on. A law is a set of rules or demands, so when I judge a brother I am questioning the way (‘law’) that God is working on him. As He is both Lawgiver and Judge, I will have to answer to Him for how I judged my ‘brothers’.
