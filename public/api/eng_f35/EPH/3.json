Does he really expect us to arrive at “all the fullness of God”?! Well, we have the Trinity going for us—the Father is granting, the Spirit is strengthening our inner man and the Son is dwelling in our hearts—an unbeatable combination (if it were not for our lack of commitment). That said, however, I must confess that I do not understand verse 18—what is Paul describing? Whatever it is, all saints are supposed to be able to grasp it, which seems rather improbable. Verse 19 offers another paradox: if the love of Christ surpasses knowledge, how can we know it? Spiritual growth is clearly a process. 2 Peter 1:3 affirms that “His divine power has granted to us all things pertaining to life and godliness.” So whether we get there or not is up to us—those who overcome will get there in Glory, if not before.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":19}},{"noteId":1418,"caller":"+","text":"Ephesians 1:19 spoke of “the exceeding greatness of His power into us who are believing”—note that the verb is in the present tense; having believed yesterday won't hack it, we must believe today. This tremendous power that God pours into us, as we believe, exceeds our powers of imagination. Well now, my personal horizon is limited and defined by my ability to imagine. Anything that I can't imagine lies outside my horizon, and so obviously I won't ask for it. I sadly confess that I have not yet arrived at a spiritual level where I can unleash this power—I have yet to make the truth in this verse work for me. But I understand that the truth affirmed here is literal, and I only hope that others will get there before I do (so I can learn from them), if I keep on delaying. The whole point of the exercise (verse 21) is for God to get glory [not for me to have a good time, although if I ever get there I will certainly have a great good time!], and to the extent that we do not put His power in us to work we are depriving Him of glory that He could and should have.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":20}},{"noteId":1419,"caller":"+","text":"The glory that God gets from the Church will go on forever.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":21}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_f35/EPH/3.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/EPH/4.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/EPH/2.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":21}
