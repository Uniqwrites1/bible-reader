phrases are parallel, so ‘Aeon’ and ‘ruler’ have the same referent, a specific person or being. This spirit is presently at work (present tense) in ‘the sons of the disobedience’. ‘Sons’ of something are characterized by that something, and the something in this case is ‘the’ disobedience (the Text has the definite article)—a continuation of the original rebellion against the Sovereign of the universe. Anyone in rebellion against the Creator is under satanic influence, direct or indirect (in most cases a demon acts as Satan's agent, when something more than the influence of the surrounding culture is required). Anyone in rebellion against the Creator will also have strongholds of Satan in his mind.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":2}},{"noteId":1390,"caller":"+","text":"This is the way people who do not belong to Christ may be expected to act. Far from being surprised, we should count on it, and our strategies (for living and evangelizing) should count on it.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":3}},{"noteId":1391,"caller":"+","text":"To be in rebellion against the Creator is to be under His wrath.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":3}},{"noteId":1392,"caller":"+","text":"This is tremendous! Here we have our authority. Christ is now seated at the Father's right, “far above” (1:21) the enemy and his hosts. This verse affirms that we are there too! So in Christ we also are far above the enemy and his hosts. We should be consciously operating on that basis, but since few churches teach this, most Christians live in spiritual defeat.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":6}},{"noteId":1393,"caller":"+","text":"The Text has ‘the’ faith; the reference is to a specific faith, presumably the body of truth that revolves around the person of Jesus.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":8}},{"noteId":1394,"caller":"+","text":"The English word ‘poem’ comes from the Greek word here, ποιημα, and is one of its meanings. Just as each poem is an individual creation of the poet, so we are individual creations, not produced by a production line in a factory.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":10}},{"noteId":1395,"caller":"+","text":"We are not saved by good works, but for good works. We do good works because we are saved, and if you don't…","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":10}},{"noteId":1396,"caller":"+","text":"“Prepared in advance”—I imagine that this refers to God's moral code, the rules of conduct that everyone should follow (if everyone did we would not need jails, rescue missions, etc.).","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":10}},{"noteId":1397,"caller":"+","text":"“The promise”—that is what the Text says. The various covenants recorded in the Old Testament differ considerably from each other, but one might say that there is one promise common to all: God promises to bless obedience, those who obey Him. To obey God one needs to have some contact with Him. Without such contact one has no hope.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":12}},{"noteId":1398,"caller":"+","text":"“His ‘flesh’ ” presumably refers to Jesus' physical body that went to the cross. Without the incarnation none of what Paul is discussing would have been possible.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":15}},{"noteId":1399,"caller":"+","text":"In this paragraph Paul is dealing with the enmity between Jew and Gentile; within the Jewish ‘religion’ Gentiles were definitely second class citizens—to be saved a Gentile had to become a spiritual Jew. Within the Church of Jesus Christ that distinction is done away with; all are on the same footing, regardless of ethnic origin.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":16}},{"noteId":1400,"caller":"+","text":"The Greek manuscripts are badly divided between “us” and ‘you’, so I follow the best line of transmission.

In what sense can that “building” be built upon “the foundation of the apostles and prophets”? Presumably “prophets” is short for the writings that make up the Old Testament Scriptures, or Canon. The Faith is based on revealed Truth, not individual people. Analogously, presumably “apostles” is short for the writings that make up the New Testament Scriptures, or Canon. Again, the Faith is based on revealed Truth, not individual people. Our “growing into a holy temple” (verse 21) depends upon the Holy Spirit and His Sword (not individuals whom God used).","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":20}},{"noteId":1403,"caller":"+","text":"There is no article with ‘spirit’; one ‘habitation’ made up of many individuals refers to the spiritual realm, not the physical.
