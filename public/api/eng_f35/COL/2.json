But Paul obviously was not there as he wrote, in fact had never been there. He affirms that it is his spirit that is doing the seeing and rejoicing. The Protestant Reformation was a result, in part, of the Renaissance, with its emphasis on reason, so Protestants in general have had trouble understanding the spirit world. So the tendency of commentators has been to ‘spiritualize’ Paul's statement, rather than take it literally. Of course they have done the same with 2 Kings 5:26 (where Elisha says his spirit went with Gehazi) and 6:12 (where Elisha listens in on the king of Syria), not to mention John 1:48 (where the Lord Himself saw Nathanael when not physically present). Here in Brazil we have many former Spiritists and Satanists who have been converted and they affirm that they used to project their spirits outside their bodies and go all over the place—several of my former students, now genuinely converted, have told me they used to do it—but they could do so only with the assistance of a fallen angel (demon). Satan's ‘thing’ is to be like the Most High, so he is always trying to imitate Him; perhaps God's servants used to know how to do this, only without such assistance [I have heard of a few in our day who still do].","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":5}},{"noteId":1318,"caller":"+","text":"“Having been rooted” refers to what has already happened; “being built up” refers to the ongoing process.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":7}},{"noteId":1319,"caller":"+","text":"The “basic principles of the world”, including the academic community (and the media, and commerce, etc.), are controlled by Satan, and are contrary to the values of Christ's Kingdom.
