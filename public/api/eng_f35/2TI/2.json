At least some (most?) [all?] of the time that people oppose Biblical values they do so because of satanic influence in their minds. Since Satan is the ‘father of lies’ (John 8:44), he is behind any and every lie. So whenever anyone embraces a lie (materialism, humanism, relativism, spiritism, animism, whatever) they invite Satan into their minds. Once there he goes about setting up strongholds. As Ephesians 2:2 says, he is actively at work in the ‘sons of the disobedience’—when you embrace a lie you reject the Truth; but then you are taken captive by the lie and wind up doing Satan's will. This process goes area by area, which explains why people can be good in one area and bad in another (the reference is not to physical skills). So when someone opposes God's truth and His values, we need to understand and remember how the person got that way; actually, they are being used. To lash out at them will not help them. A gentle, courteous probing of their presuppositions just might. More to the point, we have access to spiritual authority whereby we can break Satan's strongholds, but that gets us into the area of biblical spiritual warfare (extremely important, but too extensive to expound here). At one time I did a lot of study and work in this area and have some material that is available from my site: www.prunch.org.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":26}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_f35/2TI/2.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/2TI/3.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/2TI/1.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":26}
