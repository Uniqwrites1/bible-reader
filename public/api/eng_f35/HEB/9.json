modern versions like NIV, TEV, LB, NASB render ‘altar of incense’, thus setting up a contradiction with the Old Testament. According to Exodus 30:6 the altar of incense was placed in front of the curtain leading into the Holy of Holies, and so it was in the Holy Place, not the Holy of Holies. The only reference to this particular censer appears to be in Leviticus 16:12, where it was to be used behind the second curtain to hide the Ark with smoke. Since that censer would only be used once a year (on the day of atonement), it may well have been stored just behind a corner of the second curtain (where the high priest could retrieve it without looking in) and thus the author of Hebrews would be correct in saying that the censer was behind the second curtain, whereas the altar was in front of it. In any event, evidently that censer was only used within the Holy of Holies, and so it would be appropriate to say that the area ‘had’ a golden censer.","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":4}},{"noteId":1670,"caller":"+","text":"Oh, but I wish he had!","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":5}},{"noteId":1671,"caller":"+","text":"There was no sacrifice for deliberate sin.","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":7}},{"noteId":1672,"caller":"+","text":"Or, ‘the time of getting it right’.","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":10}},{"noteId":1673,"caller":"+","text":"We are accustomed to ‘the Eternal Spirit’, an attractive reading; I have followed the best line of transmission, albeit supported by only some 30% of the Greek manuscripts, plus the Latin tradition.","reference":{"chapter":9,"verse":14}},{"noteId":1674,"caller":"+","text":"If Christ “offered Himself”, He was both High Priest and Lamb.
