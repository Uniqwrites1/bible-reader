I suppose that ‘Jesus’ was judged to be an anachronism, and so ‘Joshua’ was elected to relieve the situation. To be sure, the Septuagint we know (based on inferior Alexandrian manuscripts) uniformly spells ‘Joshua’ as Ιησους (Jesus) [as a linguist I wonder why the translators transliterated ‘Iehoshua’ as ‘Iesus’], and perhaps in consequence, in Acts 7:45 Luke refers to Joshua as ‘Iesus’ [it was not his purpose to correct the LXX]. However, looking carefully at the context in Psalm 95:7-11, Joshua just does not fit. Consider: it is presumably Jehovah the Son who is speaking (“Jehovah our Maker”, verse 6), and since the reference is to those who fell in the wilderness during the forty years, Joshua cannot be in view. It was precisely Jesus, Jehovah the Son, who did not allow that generation to enter the ‘rest’. For further discussion please see the Appendix: “ ‘Jesus’ or ‘Joshua’?”.","reference":{"chapter":4,"verse":8}},{"noteId":1625,"caller":"+","text":"We enter God's rest through faith in Christ's Work, not through our own works.","reference":{"chapter":4,"verse":10}},{"noteId":1626,"caller":"+","text":"If soul and spirit can be separated, they obviously cannot be the same thing, just as joints and marrow are not the same thing.","reference":{"chapter":4,"verse":12}},{"noteId":1627,"caller":"+","text":"Meditating on God's Word can be uncomfortable; it is a ‘mirror’ that tells us the truth about ourselves.","reference":{"chapter":4,"verse":12}},{"noteId":1628,"caller":"+","text":"We must give an account to a Judge who knows ALL the facts.
