That future is part of our “tremendous salvation”!","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":5}},{"noteId":1591,"caller":"+","text":"I find this turn of phrase to be curious; the author knew his Old Testament well, and presumably knew he was citing a Psalm (8:4-6)—why such a roundabout reference?","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":6}},{"noteId":1592,"caller":"+","text":"The human being is superior to the angelic being in essence; we bear God's image and they do not, and once glorified that superiority will be obvious, but only for the redeemed. Those who serve Satan subordinate themselves to him, and thus can never rise above him. If Lucifer's rebellion was provoked, as I suppose, by the creation of a being superior to him, he is doing very well at getting his ‘revenge’, by depriving the vast majority of humanity of that superiority (and so the next verse does not apply to them).","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":7}},{"noteId":1593,"caller":"+","text":"Some 25% of the Greek manuscripts add, “and set him over the works of your hands”, as in TR, AV, NKJV.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":7}},{"noteId":1594,"caller":"+","text":"Instead of “lower than the angels, for a little while”, AV, NKJV and some other versions have ‘a little lower than the angels’, both here and in Psalm 8.

In this context the duration is clearly better, or so I deem.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":9}},{"noteId":1595,"caller":"+","text":"“Everyone” is not a synonym for ‘the elect’.
