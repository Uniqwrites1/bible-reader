While in Seminary, a ‘Christian’ psychologist used this text to tell our class that it was ok for a man to have anal sex with his wife: “marriage is honorable in all”! It should be obvious that it is not ok to murder in bed, to tell lies in bed, to steal in bed, to commit adultery in bed, to fornicate in bed.
