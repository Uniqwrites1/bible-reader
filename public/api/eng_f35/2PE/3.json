How can one ‘forget’ deliberately? To ‘ignore’ is deliberate; to ‘pretend’ is deliberate. When a professor or a scholar or a scientist ignores the scientific evidence for a worldwide flood he is deliberately deceiving his students or readers. To do so is to be perverse.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":5}},{"noteId":574,"caller":"+","text":"There is no definite article with ‘heavens’, I suppose because the third heaven, God's abode, is not included—the reference here would be to the first heaven (the atmosphere) and the second (stellar space).","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":5}},{"noteId":575,"caller":"+","text":"To be visible and useable (for normal purposes) land must rise above the water level, ‘out of water’, but to sustain life there must be water available on the land as well, ‘through/by water’.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":5}},{"noteId":576,"caller":"+","text":"“World” is different from “land” (v. 5) and refers to the organized world—Noah's flood did not destroy the planet earth, just the organized surface.

If we can hasten the coming, we can also delay it, or words do not mean anything. The point is, what we do or do not do makes a difference, which is why there will be an accounting. I imagine that there are outside limits or parameters that God's sovereignty will guarantee, but within those parameters it is up to us (like players on a football field—the score is up to them). So how can we hasten the coming of God's day? By living our lives to the hilt on behalf of His Kingdom, standing up for biblical values in the society at large, working to get the Gospel to the last ethnic nation.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":12}},{"noteId":584,"caller":"+","text":"God is not through creating, but since the Son will have His bride, the next time around righteousness will be guaranteed.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":13}},{"noteId":585,"caller":"+","text":"When we face the Creator are we going to see a smile, or a frown—it is up to us.","reference":{"chapter":3,"verse":14}},{"noteId":586,"caller":"+","text":"Peter repeats the truth stated in verse 9 above—just because God is not striking us down like He did with Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11) does not mean that we are getting a free ride.
