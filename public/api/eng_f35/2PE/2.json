In Hades there is a great gulf between the just and the unjust.

But if your eye is evil your whole body will be full of darkness. So if the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!” Of course we have two eyes, but the Text has ‘eye’ in the singular. I take it that the reference is to the way we interpret what we see (which is our real ‘eye’)—two people, one pure and one vile, observing the same scene will give very different interpretations to it. ‘Evil’ here has the idea of malignant, aggressively evil. Someone with a malignant mind will give an evil interpretation to everything he sees, and in consequence his being will be filled with unrelenting darkness.

Peter is saying that they will share Satan's destiny. The description given to these false teachers is unusually severe, Peter really does not like them! Since God hates those who have sold themselves to do evil (Psalm 5:5-6, Deuteronomy 7:10), so does Peter, and so must we. (Psalm 97:10 has a command: “You who love Jehovah, hate evil!” David, at least, obeyed it—Psalm 26:5, 31:6, 119:113, 139:21-22. How about us?) God's love includes hating evil, of necessity, because of the consequences of the evil. If God loves us He must be against whatever may harm us.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":17}},{"noteId":569,"caller":"+","text":"Just over 2% of the Greek manuscripts, of objectively inferior quality, omit “forever” (as in NIV, NASB, LB, TEV, etc.).","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":17}},{"noteId":570,"caller":"+","text":"Oh my, batten down the hatches! If it would have been better for them not to have known, then of necessity they are now worse off than they were before they knew (as verse 20 makes clear). But before they knew they were lost, so what can be worse than that? To be lost without a chance. Before, they were lost but had the option to be saved. But once they know the Truth, if they throw it away there is no second chance. Hebrews 6:4-6 is plain enough (if you hear someone twist the Text into a pretzel in an effort to avoid the plain meaning, you may be sure that whatever position he is trying to defend is incorrect). “For it is impossible for those who were once for all [hapax] enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become sharers in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good Word of God and the powers of the coming age, and have fallen away—it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, thereby crucifying the Son of God again, just for themselves, holding Him up to contempt.” You cannot crucify again unless you have crucified at least once already. For someone to crucify Jesus again must mean that he has indeed taken advantage of the first crucifixion, he was indeed saved—if he was never really saved he never really appropriated the first crucifixion, so he cannot do it again. I have used ‘to really know’ to translate the heightened form επιγινωσκω (in contrast to γινωσκω, ‘to know’) and ‘real knowledge’ to translate the heightened form επιγνωσις (in contrast to γνωσις, ‘knowledge’). I consider that the Holy Spirit is an intelligent and honest user of human language, so His choice of the heightened forms was deliberate. Those who seek to arrive at the intended meaning of the Text need to respect that deliberate choice. When Peter says someone has a “real knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ”, that someone must be saved. To elevate a doctrinal system above the Word of God is a form of idolatry.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":21}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_f35/2PE/2.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/2PE/3.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_f35/2PE/1.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":22}
