The verb is in the past and it is the wrath (not just any old wrath). I get the impression that ‘the Jews’ described here had passed the point of no return (like Pharaoh and the plagues—at first he hardened his own heart, but after a while God hardened it and his doom was sealed) and were just making their accounting worse and worse, ‘filling up the measure’—from God's perspective the “full impact” had already been decreed. When someone passes the point of no return, Satan takes over, and they just get worse and worse. (If you think about it, you can probably come up with some examples.) Ephesians 4:19 speaks of persons who ‘have abandoned themselves to depravity, greedily indulging in every kind of vileness’. And how should society defend itself against those who have ‘abandoned themselves to depravity’? The consequences of depravity always spill over into the surrounding society, and according to Psalm 5:5-6 the Lord hates such people, and so presumably will not ‘draw’ them (John 6:44). 1 John 5:16-17 teaches that certain sinners are beyond the reach of prayer, they have passed the point of no return. If someone cannot be saved, then he needs to be neutralized (because of the harm he causes to others)—we need to ask God to teach us how to do this.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":16}},{"noteId":223,"caller":"+","text":"I find the degree of emotional attachment described here to be surprising—perhaps a natural consequence of having poured himself into them as he did.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":17}},{"noteId":224,"caller":"+","text":"I, for one, would like to know just how the enemy managed it.","reference":{"chapter":2,"verse":18}},{"noteId":225,"caller":"+","text":"The Greek manuscripts are evenly divided between “Jesus” and ‘Jesus Christ’.
