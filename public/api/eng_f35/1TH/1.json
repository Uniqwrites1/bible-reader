However, “faith”, “love”, “hope” and “Lord” all have the definite article and are in the genitive/ablative case. If we translate the definite articles it changes the ‘flavor’; we are looking at a particular faith, a particular love, a particular hope, and the three qualities either belong to the Lord or proceed from Him. The genitive/ablative case in Greek is quite ‘versatile’, and so just to render ‘of’ all the time is so ambiguous as to leave the precise intent undefined.
