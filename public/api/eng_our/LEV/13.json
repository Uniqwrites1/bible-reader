The most significant of which is lashon harah ·evil tongue·, that is speaking evil, gossip, slander, and backbiting (Talmud, Erachin 15B) / Note: Science: In the modern age, tzara'at on a person is called Leprosy or Hansen’s Disease and tzara'at in a house or on clothing is called Mold or Mildew. Neither of these modern diseases named are not identical to the Biblical description. The Modern age does not know exactly what disease tzara'at is, it is possible the disease mutated or was only of divine-origin. Therefore, in Judaism, it was understood that only God can heal tzara'at ·leprosy· Consider: Because there was no known cure for tzara'at ·leprosy· it was like unto a death sentence in society for the person would be forced to leave everything behind, including possessions and family. The person would not feel human touch again and live in isolation or in a leper colony. Consider: The passage (Isaiah 35:5-7) is interpreted by the Rabbis that Messiah would be able to heal the blind (v5) and deaf (v5) and in addition, Messiah can cleanse tzara'at ·leprosy· because “the lame will leap like a deer” (v6). Only God is recorded to cure tzara'at ·leprosy· (Ex 4:6-7; Num 12:9-15; 2 Sam 3:28-30; 2 King 5:1-10, 5:25-27; Luke 4:27; 2 King 15:5; 2 Chr 26:16-21). There is no record of a Jewish man cleansing a leper except in (Matt 8:2-3, 10:8, 11:5; Mark 1:40-42; Luke 5:12-13, 7:22, 17:11-19)","reference":{"chapter":13,"verse":12}},{"noteId":2050,"caller":"+","text":"Lev 13:33 (#3.214): Not to shave off the hair in the tzara'at ·leprosy· infected area (See more notes in Lev 13:33 OU213)","reference":{"chapter":13,"verse":33}},{"noteId":2051,"caller":"+","text":"Lev 13:45 (Lev 13:45-46) (#3.215): For the leper to be known to all by these things: his clothes shall be rent and torn, and the hair of his head shall be loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and he shall cry “tamei, tamei ·unclean, unclean·” when walking around non-lepers (See more notes in Lev 13:33 OU213)","reference":{"chapter":13,"verse":35}},{"noteId":2052,"caller":"+","text":"Lev 13:47 (Lev 13:47-59) (#3.216): A leprous garment is unclean and causes defilement Directive: It is contagious, it shall be burned (See more notes in Lev 13:33 OU213)","reference":{"chapter":13,"verse":47}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_our/LEV/13.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_our/LEV/14.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_our/LEV/12.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":59}
