This chapter is as much about slander as it is about the disease of tzara'at. The “treatment” or punishment for such a person was being outcast for a period of time. During this time of isolation, the metzorah could reflect on the damage done by his or her words. Once the condition had been cured, the metzorah then offered a sacrifice which included two birds; one bird to slaughter and one bird to set free. Rashi says that God wanted the metzorah to sacrifice birds in order to remind the person about the sin of chattering like a bird. In Midrash Shocher Tov it reads, “The damage done by evil talk is compared to the piercing, irreparable destruction of an arrow. Why is the tongue compared to an arrow? An arrow cannot be called back once it has been shot, even if the marksman wishes to do so. Just as the victim does not know about it until it actually reaches him, so the effects of evil talk are not felt until the arrows of a wicked person pierce him.”","reference":{"chapter":14,"verse":2}},{"noteId":2055,"caller":"+","text":"MP: Only God can heal leprosy; really this is not Hansen’s disease but a divine-origin disease called tzara'at in Hebrew.
