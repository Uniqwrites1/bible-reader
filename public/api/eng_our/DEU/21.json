Note: The Rabbis do not recognize hanging as a method for capitol punishment. “Four deaths have been entrusted to the court: stoning, burning, slaying ·by the sword· and strangulation” (Mishnah, Sanhedrin 7:1) / T. Note: It can be derived that stoning was the standard method of execution (Lev 24:23; Num 15:36; 1 Kings 21:13; 2 Chr 24:21) / R. Reason: The Rabbis interpret the use of this punishment of hanging as a disgrace to the criminal and a warning to others in order to prevent more sins of the same sort (Mishnah, Sanhedrin 6:4) R. Consider: Example: According to Rabbi Eliezer, the Torah ·Teaching· commands that all executed people are hung after their execution. However, the Sages say that this is done only to the blasphemer (of God) and to the idol worshiper (Mishnah, Sanhedrin 6:4) / Note: The Hebrew word talah ·to hang· implies hanging by the hands, not by the neck and not lynching. Talah ·to hang· was usually done either with hands above the head on a plank or with hands outstretched on a T-cross beam gallows (Mishnah, Sanhedrin 6:4) / Note: The Hebrew talah ·to hang· on a gibbet type of gallows is similar to the Roman method of crucifixion on a cross, but they are not the exact same punishment in respect to the philosophies and application of punishment","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":22}},{"noteId":1006,"caller":"+","text":"Quoted in 1 Pet 2:24","reference":{"chapter":21,"verse":22}},{"noteId":1007,"caller":"+","text":"Deut 21:23 (Deut 21:22-23) (#6.415): T.
