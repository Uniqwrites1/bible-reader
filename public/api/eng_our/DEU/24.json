He says Moses gave this command only because of the people’s hard hearts. New Covenant: R. Note: Some scholars say Rabbi Paul comments on divorce (1 Cor 7:10-16, 27-28). Rabbi Paul says divorce is not to be sought, but if one spouse is a believer and the other is not and the unbelieving spouse wants to leave, then allow them; but if the unbelieving spouse wants to stay then better to remain married","reference":{"chapter":24,"verse":1}},{"noteId":1060,"caller":"+","text":"Quoted in Matt 5:31, 19:7; Mark 10:4","reference":{"chapter":24,"verse":1}},{"noteId":1061,"caller":"+","text":"Deut 24:4 (Deut 24:1-4) (#7.478): That one who divorced his wife shall not remarry her after she has been married to another","reference":{"chapter":24,"verse":4}},{"noteId":1062,"caller":"+","text":"Deut 24:5 (#5.379): T.
