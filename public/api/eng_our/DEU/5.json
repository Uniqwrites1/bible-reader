Example: Blasphemy: idolaters, manifesting disrespect towards God, and insulting His chosen leaders Note: Hebrew Language: Nakav ·blaspheme· not only signifies to curse, or blaspheme, but also to express, or distinguish by name, to invoke a name R. Example: Blasphemy goes beyond pronouncing the divine name, especially in an inappropriate context (Sanhedrin 7:5) R. Example: Judaism views blasphemy as: using God’s name when swearing, using God’s name to call as a witness for truth when lying, or by joining God’s name to inappropriate or unacceptable actions or objects (The Nine Commands, Freedman, p47-49) Note: This name, the Tetragrammaton ·four letters·, is sacred and, with one exception, is never pronounced. When the Temple stood, on Yom Kippur ·Day of Atonement·, the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest· would pronounce the Name in a sacred ceremony Consider: The Greek word Tetragrammaton is not used in the Bible, but the Hebrew name it represents, YHVH or Yahweh, is used 5,410 total times in the Old Covenant.

Reason: Sabbath is a remembrance that God rested from all his works and blessed the seventh day (Gen 2:1-3). R.
