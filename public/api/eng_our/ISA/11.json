This is known because the Hebrew word netzer ·branch· is used here. This is the only prophecy that says Messiah will come from Nazareth [Branch, Separated one]. (Consider illusion in Is 53:2). In the parallel fulfillment verse, the Greek word for Nazarene is Nazaphnoe, coming from the Aramaic word for twig or branch. Note on the Greek: The Greek word for a citizen of Nazareth [Branch, Separated one] is Nazarethaios. But Matthew uses Nazaphnoe ·branch·, not Nazarethaios [a person from Nazareth]. The King James Version of the Bible, published in 1611, translates the original Greek word as “a person from Nazareth [Branch, Separated one]” regional but modern scholars now believe this translation to be incorrect.
