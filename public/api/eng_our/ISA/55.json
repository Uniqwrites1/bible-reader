By quoting this passage, the Messiah applied the Tabernacles Water Pouring ceremony and the intention of the ceremony to himself and to the effusion and permeation of the Holy Spirit (Is 44:3). The Holy Spirit is promised to be given by Messiah and even accompanying His ministry. Bishop Lowth, in 1846, quoted an undefined passage in Jerusalem Talmud, concluding that the song in (Num 21:16-18) is to be sung in the times of the Messiah, possibly at this ceremony. The water is said to be “drawn from the wells of salvation” (Is 12:3), signifying the influences of the Holy Spirit to be given in the days of Messiah.","reference":{"chapter":55,"verse":1}},{"noteId":1692,"caller":"+","text":"Quoted in John 7:37; Rev 22:17","reference":{"chapter":55,"verse":1}},{"noteId":1693,"caller":"+","text":"Quoted in Rev 21:6, 22:17","reference":{"chapter":55,"verse":1}},{"noteId":1694,"caller":"+","text":"MP: Messiah establishes a new covenant, continuing in the same authority as God with King David, and is for a witness and a leader and commander like unto David.
