Note on textual variations: Why a virgin female as compared to young female? In the Hebrew Masoretic text, the prophecy in Isaiah uses the Hebrew word almah [a woman of marriageable age] whereas the verse in Matthew uses the Greek word parthenos [a pure virgin or woman of marriageable age]. However the translators of the Greek Septuagint, which is older than any existing Hebrew text, used parthenos in their translation of the verse in Isaiah. Therefore the translators understood the verse in Isaiah as referring to a literal virgin birth.
