In (1 Chr 24:7-18) there is a list of priestly division to serve in the Temple, scholars date this around 400 B.C.E. In Oral Tradition, the list of a weekly rotation schedule is detailed. The priests themselves lived not only in Jerusalem but also in other settlements in the land of Israel. When it was “time for the division to go up (to Jerusalem)” (Mishnah, Ta’anit 4:2), the priests left their homes, went up to Jerusalem for a week, and afterwards returned to their homes in Judea or Galilee. According to modern Rabbi Shmuel Safrai, there are 12 divisions with 24 total rotations. The first division started on the first month of Nissan (mid-March to mid-April). Abiyah’s division is #8 and therefore would serve in the second month Iyyar (mid-April to mid-May) and again in the eighth month of Chesvan (mid-October to mid-November). The divisions rotated on the Sabbath day. Divisions serving one week, twice a year.
