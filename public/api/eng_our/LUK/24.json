The book of Daniel not only speaks of the destruction of the temple, he also provides us with an exact sequence of events: “...The Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself.” And “the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.” (See Dan 9:24-26). (Dan 9:26) According to Daniel: The Messiah comes. (This happened with Yeshua’s birth between 6 B.C.E. - 1 A.D.) The Messiah is cut off, an idiom for killed. (This happened with Yeshua’s crucifixion approximately 33 A.D.) Jerusalem and the temple are destroyed. (This happened in 70 A.D.). Evidence: According to New Covenant, the Apostles worshiped in the Temple after the Messiah ascended into Heaven. Proof that Rabbi Yeshua Messiah died before the Temple was destroyed. Rabbi Yeshua teaches the Daniel prince is coming, likewise the Messiah’s death (John 12:31-33, 14:30). Details concerning the context Daniel’s prophecies are seen in (Matt 24:1-31). Daniel says, “the people of the prince” will destroy the temple; there are multiple Legions. Titus called Roman Legion 12, a people based from Syria and Asia Minor (the middle east); according to (Josephus WotJ: Book 3, Ch1, Par3). The king of Arabia Malchus sent his military (Josephus WotJ: Book3, Ch4, Par20). The standard Roman Legions 3, 5, 10, 15, and 18 are available too. The point is, the people prophesied are not definitive Roman but could be from a couple select Middle Eastern nations. The temple was destroyed at 70 CE.","reference":{"chapter":24,"verse":50}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_our/LUK/24.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_our/JHN/1.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_our/LUK/23.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":53}
