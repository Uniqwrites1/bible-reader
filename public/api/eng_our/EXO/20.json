Example: Blasphemy goes beyond pronouncing the divine name, especially in an inappropriate context (Sanhedrin 7:5) / R.

When the Temple stood, on Yom Kippur ·Day of Atonement·, the Cohen Gadol ·High Priest· would pronounce the Name in a sacred ceremony Consider: The Greek word Tetragrammaton is not used in the Bible, but the Hebrew name it represents, YHVH or Yahweh, is used 5,410 total times in the Old Covenant.

These are derived from the actions required for building the Tent of Meeting, the Tabernacle. These 39 general categories of labor that are forbidden on Shabbat. Each of these categories include a range of derivative laws and activities. The melachot ·work· are generally divided into six groups, classified according to the Tabernacle’s activities with which they are associated (Ex 20:8-11, 31:12-17) 1.
