Therefore this Savior is sent from God as Servant, Priest, prophet, and later as King to save, redeem, and establish a people unto God. This establishes that Messiah is the Angel of Yahweh. (Is 63:8-9) Messiah, as the Angel of God’s presence, acted on God’s directive to save and redeem God’s people (Ex 23:20-21, 32:34 with Is 43:11, 49:6) “for God’s name is in him [the angel] (Ex 23:21)”. Note: In combination, this prophecy is a key pin that identifies that “The Angel of Yahweh” who is also called “The Angel of God” who also shares names and titles with God and who identified with Yahweh. This is in fact the Messiah, God’s Servant at God’s right hand, sent to save and redeem by God’s command. (Is 43:11 – God is the only Savior, Is 63:8, Is 53:4-6 – the Servant who is afflicted and is in association with those in iniquity). In (Ex 23:21; Is 40:3, 40:9), the Angel shares titles with Yahweh. In (Gen 22:1-2, 22:11-12; Ex 3:2-4, 13:21, 14:19), the Angel of Yahweh is identified when Yahweh is also being identified. Yeshua says he represents Father God and are equal in (John 5:23, 10:30, 14:1, 14:9-11).
