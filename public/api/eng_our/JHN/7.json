Note: By quoting the first lines of this chapter, Messiah is referencing the entire chapter (as was a common custom of rabbis of his day because all Jews memorized the whole of Bible books), therefore the entire chapter is used to allude to his Messianic claim and be as a witness to this prophetic fulfillment. (Is 55:1-2) By quoting this passage, the Messiah applied the Tabernacles Water Pouring ceremony and the intention of the ceremony to himself and to the effusion and permeation of the Holy Spirit (Is 44:3). The Holy Spirit is promised to be given by Messiah and even accompanying His ministry. Bishop Lowth, in 1846, quoted an undefined passage in Jerusalem Talmud, concluding that the song in (Num 21:16-18) is to be sung in the times of the Messiah, possibly at this ceremony. The water is said to be “drawn from the wells of salvation” (Is 12:3), signifying the influences of the Holy Spirit to be given in the days of Messiah.","reference":{"chapter":7,"verse":37}},{"noteId":1833,"caller":"+","text":"Context: “The last day of the Festival;” Tabernacles is 7 days long It is commonly said to be eight, but that is incorrect.

(See also John 9:5-11) There he would fill a golden pitcher with water as the crowd would wave their lulavs before God and chant Hossanah ·Save now·! They would all sing (Psalm 128:25-26) while the libation was prepared. All were silent as the water was being poured out on the altar of sacrifice. After this water ceremony, as the night fell Sh'mini Atrzeret ·Eighth day Assembly· started, this is a separate and linked Festival for one day. (See also John 8:12). There was a great party like none other! The four menorahs were lit and Rabbis and students alike would put on a “light show” and “torch dances” while the Levites sang and played music; dancing before God like David danced (Sukkah 5:1)!","reference":{"chapter":7,"verse":37}},{"noteId":1834,"caller":"+","text":"Quoting from Is 55:1","reference":{"chapter":7,"verse":37}},{"noteId":1835,"caller":"+","text":"MPr: Implying the Messiah will cause a fountain to miraculously to spring up, just as Moses did in the wilderness (Joel 3:18 in Midrash Eccl 1:9).
