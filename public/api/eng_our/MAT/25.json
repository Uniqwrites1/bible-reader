This is because the festival starts on the first day of the seventh month of Ethanim, also called Tishri. Months are counted when the moon crests and starts anew, from waxing crest to waning crest. There is a possible four days in which this can occur. Therefore one must be constantly watching and listening for the watchman’s shofar blast that announces the start of the new month, and also starting the 7th month is the beginning of Yom Terurah ·Day of Shofar blast·!","reference":{"chapter":25,"verse":13}},{"noteId":2682,"caller":"+","text":"Quoted from Ps 6:8","reference":{"chapter":25,"verse":41}}]},"thisChapterLink":"/api/eng_our/MAT/25.json","thisChapterAudioLinks":{},"nextChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_our/MAT/26.json","nextChapterAudioLinks":{},"previousChapterApiLink":"/api/eng_our/MAT/24.json","previousChapterAudioLinks":{},"numberOfVerses":46}
