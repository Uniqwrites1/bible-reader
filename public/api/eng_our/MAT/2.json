This is known because the Hebrew word netzer ·branch· is used here. This is the only prophecy that says Messiah will come from Nazareth. (Consider illusion in Is 53:2). In the parallel fulfillment verse, the Greek word for Nazarene is Nazaphnoe, coming from the Aramaic word for twig or branch. Note on the Greek: The Greek word for a citizen of Nazareth is Nazarethaios. But Matthew uses Nazaphnoe ·branch·, not Nazarethaios [a person from Nazareth]. The King James Version of the Bible, published in 1611, translates the original Greek word as “a person from Nazareth” regional but modern scholars now believe this translation to be incorrect. The Bible and Matthew both make it clear Yeshua was a “citizen of Nazareth,” of Galilee, in Judea.
